Don't order from here.

Everything about this place is just bad.  Service is bad.  Food is bad.  Decor is bad.

First off, this is takeout Chinese food.  In the culinary scale, this isn't complex like French food.  It is slightly above a Chipotle.  It is the fast food of Chinese food.  Somehow they manage to suck.  Like the food was probably the worst take out Chinese food I have ever eaten.

I ordered an hot and sour soup, general tsao's, and lo mein.  All were among the worst I have ever ate.  They use subpar ingredients on everything.  The soup had no flavor and was very watery.(I had much better at a buffet)   The general tsao's tasted old and not crunchy.  The chicken didn't taste too fresh.  They had barely any broccoli.  The ones they did have noticeably old.  lo mein was okay.  I don't think they cook fresh.

Service....  what service?  First off, they barely speak English.  On the phone, the kid that picked up sounded frustrated at me.  Even if it is my fault(which it isn't), you are suppose to sound nice.  I had to switch over to Chinese to finish my order.  BTW, their Chinese isn't too proper either.  They messed up taking my order.  If I didn't review with them, they would have forgotten a item.  This place is like 10 mins walking from my place.  It took like a hour for them to get the food to me.   I think they forgot.  I called them and they delivered it.   

Decor is pretty bad.   It is a take out place.

I don't know how this place still survives.  Someone should seriously open a Chinese place down here.  Panda Express would be a huge upgrade to this place!
