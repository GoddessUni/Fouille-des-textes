We love Corner Bakery but this one was a major fail.  Eight of us were on June 25 for lunch.  My four yr old granddaughter ate her lunch and very shortly after, she three up on the floor.  My daughter and I tried to clean it up but couldn't without mopping the floor.  The manager, Brittany, came out with a bucket and mop. In front of all of us, she made a comment-this is disgusting.  My daughter was really upset as we couldn't help that a 4 yr. became so sick after eating there.  This was absolutely unprofessional and uncaring, especially since it was their food that made her sick.  I wanted to speak with the manager in charge but found out that the person who made the comment was the manager.  The only saving grace was a very kind young man named Justin, who showed empathy and concern over the whole situation.  Really too bad!
