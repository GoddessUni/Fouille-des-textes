I ordered drinks from King Fu Tea and they gave me the wrong drinks. No big deal right? Well, I called them right after and nobody answers. It was late so we just threw the drinks away and called back the next day and spoke with Jin who said it was "beyond my authority" to give a $9.63 refund. I called the owner Amy who also refused to give me a refund despite having a receipt. She said "the receipts mean nothing" and demanded I get both drinks out of the garbage then make a 30 minute round trip to the store in order to get a refund. She offered store credit, but no thank you. I'm never coming back to this place after this experience.
