My wife and I went in after a Preds game to get a glass of wine and wait for traffic to die down.  My wife was "greeted" by a man with a suit and tie.  The man was very rude and told my wife they were fully booked until 9:45.  Mean while I had grabbed a cocktail table on the patio.  My wife was so put off by the employee that she walked out of the restaurant.  I saw her walking down the street and called her back into the restaurant.  We had a glass of wine, paid and left.  The employee was in a suit, had a plaid tie.  My company had Il Mulino on our list for future business meetings (which is often) but I will remove from the list.  Suprising how someone in the service industry could be so careless.  By the way, there were three empty cocktail tables on the patio when we arrived.
