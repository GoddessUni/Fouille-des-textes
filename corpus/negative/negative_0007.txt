I will not return! Place was empty and no silverware after we got our food for at least 10 minutes. I asked for more salsa when we got our food and we were told we reached our limit. We had two tiny bowls and a medium sized one for 4 people while we waited for our food. The manager came over and didn't even offer the option to purchase more salsa. I love salsa on tacos and ended up taking  soggy tacos home. Too many other delicious options for Mexican food here in Tucson to waste your time here. Try Guadalajara on Prince, good food and good people. Plus all the table side salsa you want....
