This was one of the most disappointing places I have gone to all my spring break. I called this place around 5:00 pm to make a reservation for 12 because I know how busy it can be for spring break. We were set for a 7:30 reservation and was all ready. Once I have arrived I saw a sign that said, "Please seat yourself". At this point I started to worry because I saw a decent sized line out the door. This place was understaffed and the management was awful. People there have been waiting for hours just to get a seat. We went up and tried to ask where our reservation was and no one could help us. If this place seems crowded, don't waist your time and wait because odds are you won't get a seat.
