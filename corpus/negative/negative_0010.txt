The food is delicious but service is HORRIBLE and no matter how good the food is it makes you never want to go back! I went yesterday (Sat) with a party of 9.  We were gratefully seated very quickly but that is my last compliment.  We ordered the first round of drinks and it took 25 minutes before we received them (beers were EXTREMELY warm btw). We asked for the second round and it took an additional 35 mins all without the waitress being around long enough to order any food. We had 2 ppl who came in 15 mins after we were seated and when they gave the name the hostess said with attitude "I don't know who that is, go look around" even though it's clearly the name we gave to be seated and we told them there will be 2 more joining us before we sat. After we finally order our meals 2 hours into our visit, it took another 45 mins to receive our meal. In total it took us 3+ hrs to finally leave when we are looking to spend 1.5 at max. When we called the manager over he stated that he had just arrived and comp'd a round but overall it did not seem that anyone was very concerned about the horrible experience. I will not return and will warn anyone I know to not visit as well. What a disappointment! They only got 2 stars bc of the food!
