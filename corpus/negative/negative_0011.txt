I write this after being a close neighbor whose family had frequent take out over the last 5 years. We like the Family meal which consists of 1lb of meat, 2 sides, & their bread. Well we are gluten & dairy allergic so we go with green beans & would like dry potatoes. We have been ordering this meal like this for 5+ years, which has been longer that most managers have made it there because we have spoken with most of them over this.  So essentially we are saying keep your "6 pieces" of bread & the butter/sour cream you give with the potatoes, then just give us the 1lb meat, green beans, 3 dry potatoes for the same price. This has been a battle. Claudia the last manager was finally on board as was the manager before her. Because we did this 2-3 times a month. But the most recent manager will do it but only give us 2 potatoes, like hell, 2 is not a family. Then we started getting what we in the food service would call a "dead potato" as in getting their old lunch potatoes that is as I stated "dead"! Doesn't mash up, yellowed, doesn't soak up butter. Then we were making our own potatoes & green beans, just ordering the meat from Bandanas. They made this choice for us & we saved money that they now lose. It's17$ now when it was close to $30 and thank you instant pot! But we just go get our meat from Sugar Fire now! We gave Bandana's a lot of money & a lot of chances, been through many managers like I said. But we are done now. It's a great place for people with no allergies but they are not sensitive to those that have them.
