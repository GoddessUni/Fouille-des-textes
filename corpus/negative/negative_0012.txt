I am so disappointed with my sushi experience tonight. I wanted a "crunchy spicy tuna roll" which is $6.95 and you can pick tuna or salmon. But they have a roll called "crispy spicy tuna roll" for $11.95.  When ordering over the phone there was no clarification about which roll I wanted and if you have two rolls with virtually the same name one being double the price of the other you'd think that would be something to ask especially since the two rolls look nothing alike! I thought I was ordering a sushi ROLL. Thats how I asked for it but instead I got 12 pieces of deep fried rice cake with a little tuna on top for $24 dollars!!!!!!!! I had my friend pick up the take out because it was on here way. Before getting off the phone I even asked what the price of my meal would be and I was told that I would be given my total when I arrived at the store. This whole problem could have been avoided if I could have been given my total over the phone. I was expecting my meal to be $14 and sushi. Inside I spent $24 on something I didn't want and would never order again. 
The woman who took my order I have also had as a waitress she is an older white woman by the name of Sarah and by the looks of yelp I'm not the only person unhappy with the customer service she provides. The servers at the ybor location are very nice and friendly almost like they want to keep their job  go there.
