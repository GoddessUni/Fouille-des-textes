After a long flight, and a stomach growling for a good home cooked southern meal, I was lured in by the server outside. I was kinda nervous as to what to expect but I ordered the ribs and my mom ordered the jambalaya. Food came out, I took the first bite and the food was not hot enough. It seemed as if it was microwaved. My mom said that her jambalaya tasted like Zatarain's from thebox. The meal was just not that good, and the server kept making comments in french while walking away. The experience was not the greatest. But hey, not everybody's cooking is going to be good. I understand. I still was planning to pay full price, but when I told the server I wasn't happy with the food, he got so offended....as if iI still wasn't gonna pay! It was the place....dirty....the bread was in a basket with an empty butter package when it first arrived....the food was poor quality and was overpriced for its worth....the servers were creepy.....no, never again. If you think this place was well worth your money, you obviously don't have good taste in food and service
