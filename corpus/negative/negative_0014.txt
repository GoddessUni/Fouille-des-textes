So we got delivery from m this spot last week.  We have been customers here for a long time the food has always been what you expect from a wing spot.   They usually forget the sauces but whatever.   This time the driver owed me a little over 7 dollars and change.   He handed me the food and then 2 dollars.   He then stood there thumbing through a huge wad of money for two really awkward minutes waiting for me to be like "just keep the five and change".   Finally he looked up and said he'd have to go back to the store to get my change.   I told him "yes please do" and he never returned.    The delivery fee on top of his mandatory 35-40% tip made it relatively expensive.   This nieghborhood is chock full of cheap takeout places and this place ain't that cheap at the end of the day
