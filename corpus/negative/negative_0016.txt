Carlitos is definitely an establishment you go to to pay for the atmosphere. And I would love to give another star for that but it wouldn't do my review any service to not hold a standard. 

It is a lovely restaurant with a great vibe, which is what I loved about it. Carlitos falls short on the quality of cuisine however, which does not compensate for the fact it only looks like a restaurant where quality measures up. In reality, diners are not getting what they are paying for. Pretty much everyone in my party ordered combos and we were all let down by the realization the food was just so-so. 

The service was excellent and the location is great. I just wish the food was worthy of giving this place more stars.
