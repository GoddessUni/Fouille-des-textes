I am bummed to write this because they seriously have some great tasting smoothies but the customer service is subpar. The smoothies are very expensive and their protein is not very good. Very unengaged and extremely slow service. It will take at LEAST 30 minutes to make a smoothie when we are the only ones there. And they are not backed up with to go orders, just moving really slow. As someone who works at smoothie place, I would be reamed for the lack of energy and the slow place in this shop. Disappointing that the customer service doesn't reflect the taste of the smoothies and menu.
