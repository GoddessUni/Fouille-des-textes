This is a cozy cafe on a corner very near where I live. I have been going there for about a year and a half. I hope it's going to be one of the restaurants Robert Irvine is helping on the next season of Restaurant Impossible!
At first, it was a great, cheap breakfast place but it's been sliding downhill quickly and more so since they now serve dinner (I can only imagine...) and have a liquor license. 
We made the mistake once of ordering a hamburger and specifically asked if they would serve it rare and were told no problem. What we got was no better than an old hockey puck. It was cooked past well done. Waitress acted stupid and said that's how they serve them and when questioned about our asking claimed we didn't ask for it rare. We left immediately.
Another time for breakfast, we were ignored by our server most of the time and the bacon ordered was also past cooked to death bordering on incinerated and never should have seen a plate.
The "New Mexico" cuisine hasn't helped and if you offer a sopapilla, you should learn how to cook them!
Today for breakfast I ordered my eggs over easy and got them pretty hard cooked. I guess the deal there is to cook everything to death and hope people don't notice? My grandson wanted a hot dog and were told they went rancid and they didn't have any. It takes a long time for hot dogs to go rancid, so someone is not checking the food on a regular basis, ew.
Also, the serving staff, while very nice always seem to not know what's going on from one moment to the next. And you can tell who the favorite's are by the better treatment and attention they get.
Even as close as it is and would be a nice place to walk for a good breakfast, I'm going to have to look further.
