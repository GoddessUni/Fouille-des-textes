Man this restaurant is suffering from a major identity crisis, and it makes me a little bit sad.

When we 1st visited this restaurant a few years ago, the food was great. Delicious sushi, steak, pasta dishes and all kinds of other stuff--a really great mashup.  Then, I guess some Colombian folks bought the joint and added Colombian food to the menu, which was a nice twist. The bandeja paisa was exquisite!

 Now the restaurant is none of the above. It is simply just Mexican food, and not very good Mexican food either. 

 They have an image on their front door and on the tables of a crunchy hard taco stating that on Wednesdays tacos or $1. However, just as a heads up, please note that they do not have crunchy hard tacos at all. They got soft tacos tho, and the chicken ones that I ate last Wednesday were probably a 3 star at best.  Not terrible. Not awesome. 

Loaded fries were a joke. They came out after my meal, and were unloaded like a returned U-Haul truck. Dry and tasteless are some other good adjectives to throw at em.

Service was a joke. 4 different staff members waited on us, and they tried charging us $7.99 for 3 tacos.

I can't see how they're keeping the doors open.
