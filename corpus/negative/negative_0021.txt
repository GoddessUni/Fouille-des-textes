I have been passing this place for months and finally decided to stop for breakfast on my last day off.  The restaurant is sort of has an home town country feel to it.  The prices were about average.  I ordered the Western Skillet.  It turned out to be a load of hash-browns on a plate topped with a cut up processed chicken fried steak, topped with a scrambled egg. I personally thought it looked like a plate of someone Else's leftovers.  With that being said, my partner ordered biscuits and gravy.  He got a plate with 2 biscuits sliced in half with gravy on top for $5.99.  The 2 plates and a coffee plus tips was $25.00.  Honestly, I did not eat most of my plate and left wishing I would have stopped at McDonald's for a Sausage, egg and Cheese biscuit.  I have no desire to go back.
