I don't go here as much as I used to. I liked the original Pizza Hut that was in Turnersville (near Diamond Furniture and the old KFC - now Popeyes). I would go here often whenever I didn't have school. The lunch buffet/salad bar was the best. Ever since they moved their location next to Applebee's, it hasn't felt the same. The waiters/waitresses are usually slow and food takes forever to come out. I have to say that the place is clean and the bathrooms aren't too bad either. If you like an original Pizza Hut, head over to Glassboro. That one does gross me out a bit because it's old and needs a major upgrade.
