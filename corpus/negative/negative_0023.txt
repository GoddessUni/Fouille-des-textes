Honestly as much as I usually love going to Chipotle, I have to stop coming to this one. I feel like the employees are usually newer/training and the line is very slow. I don't have time for this on my lunch break. They also give super small portions unless you ask for more or double. And double seems to me like a regular sized portion. I have also seen lots of comments regarding hard, uncooked rice. This has not happened to me but it did happen to a coworker of mine recently. Also, I went in the other day and a customer wasn't asked for his child who was older to put on a mask until they were being rung up already about to leave. They should expect that of everyone old enough to wear a mask as soon as they walk through the door. If you have the time, go to the one in La Cumbre. It's much better than the Goleta location! :)
