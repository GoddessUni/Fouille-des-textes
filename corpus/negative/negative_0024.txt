All wrong. Wrong look, wrong temperature, wrong smell, and wrong taste. The hot saki was the only right. We ordered $75 ( 4 rolls, 2 sashimi, soft shell crab appetizer, and 2 hot saki). We only ate three bites of the food and spit out 2. We asked for the bill early and stated we would not be taking any with us. Let her know we spit some out. No credit to our bill or interest of a manager. We paid in full and tipped 20%. We love sushi but won't ever go back. We never write bad reviews but this deserved it.
