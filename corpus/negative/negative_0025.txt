I visit the Mercer Tavern for the first time with several friends on a Saturday night. The ambiance is nice but the music was obscenely loud, it might be more tolerable during the week perhaps. I was really pleased they had some vegetarian/vegan options on the menu. I had the quinoa salad and it was delicious but a very small portion for the $8 they charged. Literally about the size of small side salad. Other menu items and the drinks seemed equally overpriced. Service was okay. Overall it was an average experience and although the food was good, I wasn't impressed by the inflated prices and probably won't bother returning.
