Based on information on the website we tried to have a late lunch/early dinner here today. 
Unfortunately they apparently only have a bar/sushi menu from 2:30-4:30 and they do not seat at the tables by the water outside. 
Also the hostess was not nice to us at all. 
I've written the business and have complained. 
Also we blew $10 on parking and couldn't even eat there. 
The bar area was packed, social distancing RIGHT out the window, unacceptable. So even if we had wanted sushi or the bar menu we wouldn't do it because of the safety concerns.
You guys can do better.
