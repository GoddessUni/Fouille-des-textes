Disappointing, went with a party of four. I had the fish which sat on top of a crab cake.  Instead if the fish being white and flakey it was mushy, clear and lacking flavor. The crab cake was just ok. Both were overpowered by some type of sauce that was underneath the crab cake.  It was extremely rich and did not have a good flavor at all. I barely ate half of the dish.  I also ordered the she crab  bisque, it was not good.  It was watery and tasted fishy.  Two other people at my table ordered the same thing, they too were disappointed.  The service  wasn't good either.  The wait staff was inattentive throughout our entire meal.
