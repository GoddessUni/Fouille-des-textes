Went for dinner and drinks 3/1/2020. When being seated the table wouldn't accommodate our group of 4 so we asked to another table since they had 10 or more available. This created problems and really upset the 3 hostess. You could tell the three hostess working lacked any restaurant training or basic customer service skills. They were so happy we left almost laughing when we left. I'm not sure where the manager was but we left. We have to host an event for 10 to 15 people this week as part of a conference so we're trying a few places out. Glad we found out this place wasn't a good choice before we subjected our customer to their service. With that said be careful if you are entertaining clients and choosing this place. They have a good bourbon selection but there are many other great choices and places to spend money. We had an excellent dinner at Felix's and probably save a few hundred dollars.
