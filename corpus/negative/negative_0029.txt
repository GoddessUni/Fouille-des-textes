Just don't go here. There are other places to eat in the area. I rarely go here but did a to go order to save time. Like clockwork, when I go to pick it up it's not ready and I had to wait 7 minutes for the staff to even acknowledge me even though they were all staring at me. So finally a guy forces a girl to handle my order and she has no idea what to do. There goes more time. She didn't give me a soup and acted like it was a big deal to need to help me. She actually pawned off my order on some guy. I hate this location and will most likely never be back because it is not worth the hassle I deal with every time I go. Hire new servers that actually care and understand their job description.
