Yeah, it's the 'local ice cream place' - but they don't make their own ice cream. They also don't seem to take the best care of it. Both cones we got had ice cream that plainly had been melted and refrozen, with big ice crystals and rubbery places. (A coffee and a blueberry cheesecake.)

If I wanted supermarket quality ice cream, I'd go to Shoprite and buy a gallon for the cost of one cone at Creanies. I suspect the good rating comes down only to nostalgia, not actual experiences. (And my childhood ice cream places made their own in house.)

They only get a second star because they're open all year.
