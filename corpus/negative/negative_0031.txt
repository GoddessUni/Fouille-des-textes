Walking into the place I was very skeptical due to the "run down" look of the exterior. My girlfriend and I walked in and decided to order asap because we were famished. I ordered "banana foster" French toast and she, "day and night" french toast with a side of bacon. We waited way too long for our food to come out and even watched the food sit at the pass for at least 7 minutes. So boom foods now on the table and my French toast had no banana on it, weird. I decided not to say anything because of how hungry I was. Both of our food was cold and so were the 3 strips of bacon, which were $4 by the way.  Waitress was nice but never checked on us during service.. late into our brunch we noticed the place was quite. There was no music which was a slight disappointment. Our check was brought back to us by a different waitress and our waitress never even said goodbye or thank you for stopping in. Overall a very disappointing time. Needless to say I wont be returning.
