I used to go to this Subway on an occasional basis to grab a quick bite for lunch or dinner.  Last November was the last time I will ever step foot back into this location.  I came in with 2 coupons.  Usually most places will run two separate charges so using 2 coupons isn't a big deal.  I ordered my sandwiches and went to checkout.  The owner refused to honor the second coupon and gave me an attitude.  Honestly, the customer service in this location sucks.  Owner also did not give me the corporate napkins too, which could possibly be a violation of their franchise agreement.  Corporate, please take note.
