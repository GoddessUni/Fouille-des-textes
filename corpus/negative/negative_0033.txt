Don't come here during lunch rush. It does get busy and the staff is not equip to handle the hustle and bustle. We were quoted a 30 min wait, make sure to stay close by. If not, you'll get passed. Also, if you have a bigger party you get seated prior to two person parties like us. Then expect to wait 10 min just to see your waiter so since you're waiting make sure to check out the virtual menu so you know what to order. Now just waiting on our greasy food. Drink order came quickly except for my float which takes longer to slush together than a fountain drink. Food is greasy but what do you expect from a diner? The food is good though.
