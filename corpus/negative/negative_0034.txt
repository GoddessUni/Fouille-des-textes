Tonight was my first and last time here. Aside from the owners somewhat witty responses to negative reviews, all negative reviews hold validity. This place sets a great example to why the game of billiards will die generationally. We are all in our 20s and were met with an obvious attitude bias towards our age. The older man working there (who seems to be the owner) has a short bitter attitude that creates an unwelcoming atmosphere. First words when we came through the door was "no outside food or drink. No hoodies. And ID". I am used to bitter old men. But what is a bother is watching as he proceeds with more concern, attention and genuine customer service towards elder customers whilst continuing to be shallow with any new younger customer. May sound petty but it is something you have to see to believe. You may have been in business for 25 years, but your customer base is changing to younger generations. You WILL NOT continue a successful trajectory unless you can drop the ego, and be more welcoming and warming to the customers that are supporting you. I'd say this to you in person if I had the chance. However you seemed more concerned with finishing the tab and continuing conversation with the 2 ratchet drunk girls at the bar. Maybe you got lucky. Or maybe they leaned on a pool table and spoiled the night for you.
