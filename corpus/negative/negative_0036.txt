First experience here was in July and it was lovely. Last night it was terrible. Our order was screwed up and my husband had to wait for over an hour for a burger while the rest of our table had finished eating. I ordered the mussel special which sounded delicious. My bowl came with many empty shells and many closed shells and the mussels were sticky and salty and pungent. There was no broth and they stuck to each other. The flavor wasn't terrible but it was too intense and I could not eat more than 3 without feeling ill. I'm not sure if hat was the intention or a misfire. 

We won't be returning. 

Also, please turn in the heat!
