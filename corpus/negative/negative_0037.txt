Last time I went, I was there for breakfast and as a solo business traveler, they offered me to be smushed between 2 men at bar or at the low wheelchair location which I didn't want to sit at but ended up at.  So, the same problem occurred as the previous time - that bartender/server ignores customers.  The breakfast meal was cold and with a huge piece of bread - why would anyone want that?  I couldn't get any water, and had to go to a table to ask a guy if I could borrow his salt and pepper.  I also could not get any ketchup or hot sauce.  Basically, not good for breakfast - "Hueves your way."  Don't do it!  This was on the right side of the bar.  The Asian guy who works on the left side (if you are facing the bar) is attentive!
