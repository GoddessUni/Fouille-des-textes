THE REASON WHY VIETNAMESE ARE NOT IN LILY'S CAFE

Me and my (Vietnamese) friend went to eat here and we ordered two vermicelli bowls. I ordered the spicy shrimp and she ordered the grilled beef with spring rolls on both. I have never tasted this so I didn't know how the spring rolls are supposed to taste. My friend is from Vietnam  so she definitely knew how it should taste, she said the spring roll was sour and had a spoiled taste. She asked the server if the spring rolls was supposed to be like that. The server took the bowl and they agreed on changing the meal for another. A minute later, the owner comes out. She acted  like dr.Jekyll and mr.Hyde. She was very nice to me at first then she looks at my friend asks her in Vietnamese if she speaks Vietnamese. As soon as my friend says yes, she goes crazy!! Telling her that since she is Vietnamese she shouldn't be against Vietnamese restaurants. Also, that because I almost finished my food that my friend has no case for saying that the food is bad. She told my friend that my friend has an attitude. All because she said the food was spoiled?!?!?  Mind you, I've never tasted spring rolls before so how am I supposed to know? ANYWAY. If the food was bad the last thing I would expect is that the owner would yell at another customer and not tell her SORRY. My friend isn't coming back because of the food and I'm not coming back because of the service. 
ALSO IF YOU LOOK AT OTHER REVIEWS OF VIETNAMESE PEOPLE REVIEWING LILY'S CAFE THEY SAY THE SAME.
