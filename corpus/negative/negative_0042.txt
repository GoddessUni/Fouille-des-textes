I don't even want to waste time reviewing this place.   Do not waste your money, do not waste your time, avoid at all costs.   Wings are super fried, taste greasy and you'll wish you could get rid of the oil taste in your stomach after eating them.  The sauce is overwhelming and will drench your wings to death...probably to hide the nasty taste of the oil. 
The fries were covered in so much seasoning that they were unedible...I had to throw them away.  I also did not finish all my wings as they were absolutely disgusting.  

You could not pay me money to come back here
