The place has a red lobster vibe. We came for dinner and it was crowded; not sure why though. 

Fresh oysters and BBQ shrimp were good; crawfish boil was not. The crawfish were small even though the waiter said they're getting big. The meat was mushy as if they weren't fresh. The flavor was also ehh. The seafood platter was whatever too. We didn't like the crawfish croquettes or the stuffed crab meat. They were both too mushy and the flavor was a bit off. 

Our waiter was nice but sassy and we just didn't get his humor, so it was always awkward.
