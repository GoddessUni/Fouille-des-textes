I took my daughter and my niece for what we thought was going to be a treat.  It was not.  We were asked if we had reservations (only one table was occupied), the owner seemed like we were inconveniencing her, she made a comment about how "all these tables are reserved" and made a big deal about pushing two tiny tables together and taking away one place setting.  

We decided on "high tea", which was $18.95 (ouch) each for me and my daughter and $9.95 for my niece.  My daughter is a vegetarian and we told the owner.  She was accommodating, letting her pick her five sandwiches.  My daughter and I were both served five soggy tea sandwiches, a mini quiche (with ham!), a scone and three other store bought, frozen desserts.  My niece was served three soggy tea sandwiches the size of my index finger, a mini cupcake and a store bought suger cookie.  The tea was lukewarm, the food barely filling and mediocre at best.  I did enjoy my rose petal tea and the scone.  My niece said she had made better tea herself, at home.  We laughed.

I was not laughing, however, when I received the bill.  We were served mostly by the owner who added an automatic 20% gratuity "for parties of 3 or more" (I'm not kidding - she actually wrote that on the check) after she added the tax.  Who does that?!  You don't tip on tax and you certainly don't tip the owner!  

I paid our $61.44 lunch bill only because I knew I'd never go back.  The girls, who are 14 and 11, had enough sense to say the food was lacking and in the words of my niece "You can't tell people what to tip.  That's rude."

Oh, and those "reserved tables," they were never occupied and the owner actually turned people away.
