Came in here on a Friday afternoon around 3 pm.  I'd say this is an average bar restaurant.  Prices were higher but it wasn't typical bar food.  They're trying to be a nicer airport restaurant that serves nicer meals instead of quick bites I think.

I would've been ok with this place but I'm a stickler for cleanliness.  The bar had food on it and I didn't see them wipe the bar down.  The bartender used her bare hands to make my drink, hand pick the garnish, etc...not a huge deal but here's where it set me off.

The bartender dropped a full bottle of liquor and proceeded to pick up the pieces with her bare hands also.  Then she proceeded to mop it up and even wiped off the bottom of her feet with her hands!

Luckily she didn't deliver my food, but my napkin that wrapped my cutlery had hot sauce fingerprints on it.  Come on, guys.  She was taking other people's used plates away and making drinks and hand picking lettuce for salads or garnish.  I didn't see her wash her hands.

That's why this place gets a 2.  Food was actually good.  I had the chicken quesadillas.  Very filling, but the woman wiped the bottom of her feet!  I'll have to Purell my mouth before I kiss my mother next!

She came out with a plastic glove on her hand at one point.  Hope she didn't cut herself on the glass!
