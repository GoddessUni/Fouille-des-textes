Repeat reviewer.  We live close by so EM is a convenient, quick, inexpensive dinner out with decent food.  And BYOB is always good.  

Something was amiss on our visit last week.  Steak in the tacos was really grissley and chewy and not flavorful.  Rice was cold.  We've gone to EM like 20 times and it's going downhill a little bit. This visit was a bottom.  Wait staff is too slow and not that friendly. Food took much longer than usual to come out. Carnitas tacos had shredded pork; I could swear it was marinated sliced pork before.  Not flavorful. Pretty bland.

Salsa is good but way too watery.  I am almost sure it's just from a jar.  Gotta thicken it up.  And OK if you change nothing else, you have to serve the salsa in small bowls, not in little disposable plastic cups.  The chips don't even fit in the teeny little cups.  And with the watery salsa, forget it.  Make good salsa, get red salsa as an option and get real salsa bowls!
