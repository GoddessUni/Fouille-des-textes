We came here because it was dog friendly.  I thought that was pretty cool and wanted to try it and also I can bring my four legged son. But it was all down hill from moment we sat down. Associates are not friendly it took 10 or so to get our first round of drinks. My dog didn't even get water til we asked. When we finally got our food our drink was half way gone and waiter didn't even ask if we wanted a refill.  So we waited and no one came to check on us. My husband actually called the restaurant ask for a manager and said we needed a refill and our waiter hasn't come to do refill it. Manager Amy apologizes and finally our drinks came. Waiter didn't even apologize and just hands it out.  Some people just have no customer service skills and shouldn't work where u have to interact with customers.
