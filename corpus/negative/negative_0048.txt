Not so fresh if your selling refrigerated meat with frozen lettuce and everything else...I order an avocado Cobb salad with extra avocado and croutons $14 dollars Only 2 pieces of frozen avocado!!
I ask if they can warm up the chicken, to be told that they don't offer that service, beyond disappointing. 
The idea of this salad bar is great I seriously had high hopes since I'm hands down a  salad lover and this place is near my job however It's all false advertising FRESH FOOD! If the case is covid (air bunny's) than they need to reevaluate their servings.

Please don't waste your time and money you have a better chance of a fresh salad ordering from a diner.
