This review is based on 5 visits to Table over the past year. Overall the service has been great......accomodating hostesses, friendly servers, visible management. Having children, we are appreciative of them accommodating families with children. The food started out amazing: out-of-the-boring-Indy food box with tasty, different menu choices. The most recent visits have proved otherwise; luke-warm if not cold kids food, burned kids cheeseburger, cold soupy macaroni & cheese, and the most devastating: dry, chewy, taste-less corned beef (which was once mouth-watering and AH-mazing). Upon showing the on-duty manager the corned beef, her comment was "That looks unedible!" Thanks for the past year Table, but we will be trying & visiting other restaurants that are a better value for our money. Hopefully things change for the better and business continues and/or improves!
