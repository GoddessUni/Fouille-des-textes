So never been to this outback, apparently they are under renovations. Since I got back to this area at 9:30 & most restaurants close by 10 really didnt have much of a choice. 
So there was 3 of us & we all got steak. 
So my steak was good, I got the filet. 
My daughter had a sirloin w/ unlimed shrimp which was fine too. 
Third steak not so good. So it was supposed to be medium & came out rare. The server took it back & said np ill get u another. 5 minutes later it comes back 3 bites into it hubby noticed a hair. It was a short black hair, me & my daughter have long & my hubby medium length. Lets just say that was the end of the meal. Manager apologized & comped his meal..
