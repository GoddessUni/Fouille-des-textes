Oh Elevage, we had such high expectations and sadly you did not deliver. To start, valet parking is the only option with a $5 price tag. Not too bad other than the fact they do not accept credit cards for the transaction and thier hotel ATM is not in service yet. 
Walking into the restaurant, we enjoyed the ambiance, but felt transformed like we were in the middle of Wisconsin. The staff seems very under dressed and not very well trained in the art of food service. I'm sure Elevage is trying for some sort of rustic appeal, but it just didn't seem to land. 
Then we got to our drinks and meal.  We're more liquor than wine drinkers and I had to send my drink back. I asked for a manhattan and I received what I can only describe as what tasted like gasoline. The waiter was unapologetic and did not ask to have the bartender remake it. So I went sans cocktail and stuck to my tap water. My boyfriend ordered the German potato soup and no spoon came with it. By the time out waiter came back his soup was cold. Out came our entrees, my steak sandwich seemed to be lacking the steak and the accompanying onion rings tasted like pure salt. My boyfriend enjoyed his salmon but unfortunately became sick later that night and thinks it was not fresh. All side items are ordered ala carte and pretty costly after taking into account what you are already paying for the entree. 
Decided against dessert (we suffered enough). Overall, not impressed with Elevage and will not be returning. There are too many other fantastic places to eat in Tampa with better service! I hope for their sake they can turn it around. It was more than a few hiccups for us and poor service is inexcusable in this day and age.
