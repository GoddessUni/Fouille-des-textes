Let me start off by saying, I've been to Michael's ONCE and never again.  Not only did I get thrown out for telling someone to keep their hands off my wife, but, when I wrote a negative review, Michael's cried to Yelp to remove my review.  Poor babies who cannot stand up and be scrutinized and Shame on Yelp for removing a review that didn't contain foul language or names.  Yelp and Michael's are a good fit for public deception.  Unfortunately, you will not have a chance to read an honest review of this business so you'll have to go there and experience the scuzziness for yourselves.
