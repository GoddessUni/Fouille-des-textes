I ordered take-out from Han Dynasty for dinner last night. I won't make that mistake again. The host and wait staff were very helpful and polite. 

I wish I could take the people giving this place 4 and 5 stars to two restaurants in Pittsburgh: Everyday Noodle, where the noodles are made fresh every day, and Szechuan Gourmet, the kind of Chinese restaurant that's filled with Chinese people and has 2 menus, the fake one and the real one. This is not a Pittsburgh versus Philly thing -- I'll be in Philly for 4 months and would be thrilled to find some awesome Chinese restaurants.
