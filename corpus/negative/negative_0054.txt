Ra is my favorite  and we go a few times a month I have always had good service except for this past Saturday night.  9/27 we had a party of 6 and our food and service was great we cashed out with our waitress inside so we could go sit outside by the bar unfortunately there was no seating out side in the bar area so we asked the bartender if we could sit on the patio on the other side and was told yes.  We sat outside in the patio area and the waitress never once asked us if we needed anything or even look at us while she served another table next to us.  So we got her attention and asked her if we could get a beer she looked and us like we were bothering her and said sure.  We were out on the patio for at least 1 1/2 hours and never got out beer water or even looked at again.   After this I don't know if we will be returning to ra again due to the rude waitress which is a shame because the food is great.
