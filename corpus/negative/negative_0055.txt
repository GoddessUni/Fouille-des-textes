We stopped in for a drink thought we might eat dinner there, the menu looked Fantastic! So we went to the bar and ordered a drink from the RUDEST BARTENDER EVER!!!!!! Older man with white hair and a white gotee / beard. He acted as if we were bothering him and attended to other bar patrons with out the rudeness. I am amazed that this bartender still even has a job talk about Grumpy! So we ended up not eating there and went to Arnaud's and I have to say skip Broussards go to Arnaud's great food, great service  Pass if you want any service
