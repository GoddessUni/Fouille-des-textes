We really only gave the Boat House two stars because it is on the beach. First the food. Very poorly presented and at best a 5 out of 10. Really, don't waste your money here. Skip the Caesar. It's bland at best. We ordered the local sole and the filet. The sole was fresh and tasted OK but was soaked in butter and dumped on top of a pile of random vegetables that had no flavor. The filet was bacon wrapped (who does that anymore?) The color was a weird grey with a strange pinky red sauce that was gross. Buried underneath were these  mashed potatoes that somehow curdled. We asked for a little garlic bread and it showed up black and burned on the bottom, which we didn't realize until we took a bite and wondered if the kitchen was on fire. Look there are a lot of really super places to eat in Santa Barbara. Lastly when we repositioned our table so that my wife and I could sit next to each other, rather than across the table, we were admonished by the manager even though it had no effect on the space or area for the server. Later two other couples saw what we did and flipped their tables to do the same thing. That ought to tell them something. Bottom line, don't get fooled into eating at the Boat House just because it's on the beach. Go to the beach and then eat somewhere else.
