Just had our visit here and we will not be returning. Everything tasted like it soaked in oil all day and most of the chicken selections were lukewarm at best. Lo mein noodles were disgusting, potatoes had no flavor, and the dim sum I cut into was pink inside. We told the manager how unhappy we were. All the manager could say was "if that's how you feel then don't come back." The lack of concern for customers' opinions is parallel to the lack of care put into the flavor and skill of the food here. Do not waste your time or money.
