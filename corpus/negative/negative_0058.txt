This dining experience was the first time my husband and I have ever complained about our meal to a server in over ten years of dining together.  We ordered three appetizers and a salad Sunday afternoon when the restaurant did not appear to be particularly busy.  We waited over an hour for the first dish to arrive, which was mediocre at best.  The second dish we were served were chicken wings that were so severely undercooked they were inedible.  After waiting over 1.5 hours at this point we asked for the remainder of our meal to be boxed up to go as we were no longer enjoying the dining experience. We were given a gift card for approximately half the price of our meal, however this will go unused as we will positively never set foot in this restaurant again.
