Super rude manager and server. Bartender could not have cared less or smiled less either. One female waitress from the main floor was overly friendly and sweet- talked to my daughter while we waited for a table. Busboy was awesome. Server was slow af and when I very very politely asked for a rewater, he held out his hand as if to say calm down. Then he ignored me for en minutes. That's one example. The manager was super rude. Never wanted to listen to anything. I am almost positive this is a family owned and run restaurant. No other explanation for such horrible service and apathy. Will not be back. Ever. Will tell EVERYONE I know to save their time and money. 

*****UPDATE- I sure hope you can all see Cindy's comments. Seriously, it's proof of how lousy and self centered their customer service is. I'm unhappy so it must just be me?  Awesome. Just so you know, your food isn't NEARLY good enough to warrant this horrible service. I must not have been clear enough. The FRIENDLY waitress and AWESOME busboy were the ONLY redeeming aspects to your business. As a well trained former restaurant manager, I like to always find a positive when critiquing someone. That was my compliment. That was it. 

Please please take my advice and get yourself a customer service consultant (I assume this is falling on deaf ears). One should never start an "apology" with "I have to push back" or include comments like "sounds like you wouldn't have been happy no matter what". I compliment great service on a DAILY basis. Both publicly and in-house. Learn how to take the negative and improve.
