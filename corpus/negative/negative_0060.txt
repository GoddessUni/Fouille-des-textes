WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!

...and I do not say that lightly. My family attempted to grab a bite before our delayed flight home which turned into the longest wait of our lives. 

75 MINUTES!!! ....and still NO FOOD!

At that point we finally walked out. Our flight was delayed 2 hours or else we certainly would not have waited that long.

We were warned for a potential 30 minute wait upon sitting down but with the delay thought it would be reasonable. At 45 min we were assured our food was coming. At 60 min we were told the ticket got lost but would be out soon. By 75 we gave up and headed to the cheaper burrito place at the other end of the terminal where we were served in under 5 min.

Oh and we only ordered 2 sandwiches and a cheesesteak, nothing fancy.

Plus the drink menu has no prices listed so you don't know you're getting screwed.

Still fuming. Would give 0 stars if possible.
