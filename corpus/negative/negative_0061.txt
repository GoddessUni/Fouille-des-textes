I literally pay just to shop here. I should not be harrassed by all the stupid vendors they have inside trying to sell me shit. Leave me alone.
Last time I was there, they had FIVE different vendors around the store harrassing customers. It is extremely unprofessional. I expect that type of harrassment at a Mall. I don't pay extra to shop somewhere for the same shitty experience. If you want loyal customers, don't extort them for their money. 

Also their gas station is horrendous to use. They recently changed it so traffic flows one way. This still does not fix the problem as you have to enter from the opposite side to the flow of traffic. They need a similar set-up to what Costco has; where you enter from the side with the flow of traffic and exit on the other side.
