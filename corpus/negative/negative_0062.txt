Went here for the first time with people who grew up going here. HORRIBLE experience.  The manager Angel came over when we first sat down and seemed very nice, however the minute there was an issue he changed his tune.  One of the people in our party ordered the carpet bagger which was a filet with crab meat. They asked for it medium but when it came it was so well done it was grey.  We asked the waitress to return it and please bring another one.  25 minutes later the rest of the party was done eating and her steak wasn't back yet.  We asked the manager and his response was very rudely "it takes time."  When she finally got her steak the manger came back over and asked her to cut it in front of him.  The steak was now blood raw. He stood there and finally said "well what do you want me to do about it??"  At this point we asked for them to just take it off the bill since the rest of the party was long done eating. Angel did not like this apparently because he pulled the plate away and said "you ate the salad bar so I'll charge you for that."  Absolutely outrageous management. We asked for a second manager who was much better at her job but sadly none of us will ever return and they have Angel to thank for the loss of business.
