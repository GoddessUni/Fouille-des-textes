I have to comment since I'm seeing either rave reviews or completely negative ones, I have to conclude the quality of their staff on duty at the time you visit must be the common denominator here. We went at lunch on a Saturday and the place was dead. We chalked it up to being new and unknown...we too were unimpressed with the menus; not only do they appear to have been printed in a rush because someone forgot to order real menus before they opened their doors, but they're also in paragraph form which took me forever to read and decide what I wanted. I finally gave up and asked the waiter for a suggestion. I ended up taking it and getting the huarache with steak which kind of tasted like a steak chalupa from Taco Bell but not as good...and I can't stand Taco Bell. The kids meals were the best thing on our table and honestly I'd order the kids chicken quesadilla if I was ever coerced into stepping foot in here again. We had a few margaritas and our lunch was seriously about what we would have spent at Uncle Julio's in Brentwood, which is at least worth the money. As mentioned the staff was friendly but forgot everything and were extremely slow. As in, we were about done with our lunch before my husband got the jalape√±os he asked for when he ordered. 
On a (slightly more) positive note, the guacamole was delicious...it just took so long it came after our food arrived at the table, so don't expect it to be an actual appetizer. This place needs to seriously step up their game if they expect to survive in Cool Springs.
