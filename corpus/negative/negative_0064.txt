I had the the Raw Earth salad and my daughter had the Deity salad. Both were doused in dressing, with a horrible onion flavor that gave me heartburn, and both were virtually inedible. We both threw our salads in the garbage. The people working there also had an attitude... we paid for a 20% tip, and they wouldn't even take our food to us outside -- or to any table, for that matter. I won't be back. It's sad to see people at vegan restaurant with such a bad attitude.
