So, when did too much horseradish become a claim to fame?

This place has not been good for almost ten years now. It's riding on an outdated reputation and doing nothing new or exciting. 



I was sucked into eating here with a business associate and couldn't believe how lackluster everything was. My companion ordered the shrimp cocktail, and forced me to try it despite my insistence that I've had it before, and it was the same over-spiced nonsense it was years ago. I say that as a lover of spicy foods, but if I wanted to eat a chunk of horseradish, I'd eat a chunk of horseradish. One can't even taste the shrimp: it's just a spoon for the sauce.

Steak were...fine? At these prices I expect better than fine.

There are too many great restaurants in Indy to waste your time here.
