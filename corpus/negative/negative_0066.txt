This place is absolutely ridiculous, literally only came here because I had a gift card, but had to download a stupid app and they said I needed to put a credit card in but they said not to worry I won't be charged. So I thought nothing of it and ordered the mahi tacos and a couple of beers. The food took literally an hour to get to us and the mahi was the driest I have ever tried it was disgusting. My buddy talked to the manager and she said she would comp the meal and replace it. Well when the bill came she charged us for the comped meal it was absolutely ridiculous. So disgruntled and disappointed we paid for the meal with a gift card. So just today I check and see that I had a charge from the getaway when I specifically paid with a gift card. So I am trying to get a hold of them and phone is ringing, but they are not picking up the phone I am livid right now and shocked. Not only did they charge from the app, but also they added a five dollar tip when we already tipped the waiter on the gift card. I would avoid this place at all costs they are crooks the ambiance is not worth the terrible service and mediocre food.
