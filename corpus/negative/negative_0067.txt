I hate writing one-star reviews. But I truly felt that this place lacked in almost every area.  We went there late Friday night around 10:40 p.m. to grab wings, since we were in the area.

1. there was only one server; she was the bartender, server, and buser.
2. i ordered the crescent wings, described as "sweet and savory." there was no sweet, nor was there savory. 
3. friend ordered regular wings, but she returned them because she said they were nasty; too dry. 
4. we also ordered the big cobb salad. it was good. I gave to my friend since she didn't have anything.
5. the server should have told us BEFORE WE ORDERED that their credit card machine was down. had she informed us, we would have either gone to the ATM or went elsewhere. perhaps she knew that - whatever the reason she didn't tell us was dirty. 
6. my friend had money for her salad, but i do not carry cash. So...i waited for around 30-35 minutes - they called the IT people, they couldn't get it, blah blah blah. I asked the server if the restaurant could eat the cost of the wings ($7.00) since it was taking so long, and we weren't notified at the beginning of our meal. she said no. 
7. i should have just walked out, but i was really trying to do the right thing. looking back, i should just said "deuces," and left.
8. Finally the machine was up and running. My bit was $7.00. She charged my card $11.00. I verified that my card should have been $7.00, and she threw the $4.00 cash on the bar.
9. I felt bad for her, because it was not the server's fault; but i WAS frustrated that she did not inform us appropriately, until we got the bill. That was wrong, in my opinion. 

So, i will not return. The ambiance is young and hipster, with head-banging type music playing. Not so much my scene. I would have been OK with it had everything else not occurred.

That was one of the worst experiences i have ever had at a restaurant, and I felt very torn leaving; angry, frustrated, feeling bad for her, but annoyed.
