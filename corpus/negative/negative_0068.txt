The location is probably the best part of the hotel. I would not stay at this location due to the customer service of this establishment!! I spoke with a representative to get room service and she was bothered by me placing an order! I asked what her name was due to her being super unfriendly. I then called back to guest services and asked to speak to a manager and lucky enough I got her and she wouldn't transfer me until I told her the reason why I needed to speak to manager which is very unprofessional. I then got across to the "manager" who then was very unhelpful and unapologetic. He then told me they didn't have an employee that goes by that name. Meaning the employee lied to me when asking her name. The manager stated he has been on duty and didn't think there has been any customer service issues. Basically nothing was solved but something so simple will make me never come back to this hotel. Customer service and a genuine apology goes a LONG way.
