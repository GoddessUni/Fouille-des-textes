I got a double hamburger, fries and a chocolate shake.

The fries were very good! Shake was good (I've had many better).

Burger was awful! All I added to my burger was ketchup... I'm a purist like that... it was way overly greasy, and tasted very bitter. They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked so I figured I would get it Well to Mid Well... It was on the light end of mid well, which was okay.

We didn't wait in line long because it was pouring buckets outside and only waited about 5 minutes... Thank god we didn't wait longer.

I don't think I'll be going back there!
