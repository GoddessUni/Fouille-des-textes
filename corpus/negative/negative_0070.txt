After spending 40$  on delivery our order was incorrect upon delivery . We ordered through  uber eats . I called to let them know we received the wrong things and needed the driver to bring us the right food. The woman was horribly rude who answered the phone. She told me it was on us to correct his mistake . Then slammed the phone down on me . Uber drivers pick up outgoing orders . Not package them . This CLEARLY says it was for pick up and not delivery . It was not the drivers fault,  but someone at the Dim Sum Garden . This was actually the second time this happened to us . We gave it a second chance being the food was good. NEVER again . They are unprofessional and really don't need to be participating in any delivery APP . If this happened to us twice , I'm sure we are not the only ones . 

The first picture is our order  from uber eats. The second is the incorrect  order that clearly states PICK UP .
