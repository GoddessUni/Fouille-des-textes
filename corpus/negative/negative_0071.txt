Great beer prices (PBR on draft!), cool classic arcade games and a friendly staff. 
Prices for food is pretty good too. 
Fries were great and tots were awesome.

Unfortunately the kitchen was WAY off on anything they had to actually prepare (as opposed to toss in a fryer). 
My burger was raw (not rare, RAW ... and certainly not the medium I ordered). When brought to the manager and server's attention both promised to "take it off" however we got a full bill. Unforgivable for a burger joint to screw up a burger. 
Nachos were a glopped mess and the patty melt was so greasy my son couldn't eat it. 
Then we sat with empty cups, obviously done for 10 minutes waiting for our bill ... we finally got up and asked for it from the server who was chatting with friends.
Very unfortunate. I'd read good reviews and was hoping to have a local burger joint to enjoy. Next time we're up for a burger we'll head to the newly opened Red Robin.
