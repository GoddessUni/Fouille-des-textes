I wanted to like this place but alas, it was not meant to be.  The Wife and I stopped in for dinner.  Friendly employees and a clean environment but it comes down to the food.  

We both ordered a 10 piece of Jumbo Shrimp which come with 2 sides.  I ordered the mashed potatoes and green beans while The Wife went with fries and coleslaw.  The Shrimp were hot, crispy and tasty.  My sides were none of these.  The potatoes were luke warm at best and the beans took me straight back to the 1960's.  Neither had nearly enough seasoning.  The Wife fared better with fries even though they weren't crispy and a serviceable slaw.

My sides were so blah that I doubt I will ever return.
