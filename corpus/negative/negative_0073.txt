Recently went there for brunch one Saturday and the place was empty except for us.  Granted, we were having a late brunch - but breakfast in the afternoon was our plan.  There were five of us and we were seated right away.  We ordered a few drinks and were pleased with the extensive beer list.  However, apparently they keep their stock low of some of the less popular bottles.  One of my friends asked if she could have a certain beer - the server returned about 5-10 minutes later and said they were out of that beer and asked her to pick another - out of that one as well.  This makes for a challenging experience.

The food is actually very good.  I gave it two stars simply because of the title being out of line with them being unaware of the varieties they are out of stock.  For brunch, I had the typical Western Omelette which was a sizable portion and came with home fries, toast and fresh fruit.  They understand we could have gone to a diner so they give high-class restaurant quality in diner-size portions.  They were in the holiday spirit and had Pumpkin French Toast - admittedly you would probably not be disappointed if you ordered that.

If you're not at Barrel House to drink, then I recommend going for a Coke and Brunch.  But if you're wanting to drink without a wait to find a beer that's in-stock, might be best to go elsewhere.
