Great food, great staff...HORRIBLE MANAGER/OWNER.  It was a Sunday night, not slammed, not empty.  The dinner special, which is traditionally a dish put on the menu because it's easier to make than others on the menu took 45 minutes.  When the food finally arrived, delivered by the owner/manager, I expressed my frustration that it took so long.  He challenged me on the time, checked the ticket, admitted that it did in fact take 45 minutes.  When I asked him how he thought that was acceptable (clearly it's not) he said "There's nothing I can do about it."  YOU OWN THE PLACE!  There is plenty you can do about it.  For starters, treat paying customers, especially ones that are understandably dissatisfied with some respect.  He left it to the wonderful bartender to comp my meal and my beer, which was so lovely of her, but a d*ck move on his part.  

PS, It was my third time there in the space of the weekend, because it was close to my hotel, recommended by the bellman (it's where he would go to eat) and the food is really good.
