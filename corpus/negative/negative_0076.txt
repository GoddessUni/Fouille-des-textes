While the view is spectacular, that's really all I can give good reviews. I don't mind paying a ridiculous price for a good drink. But, these cocktails had average craftsmanship at best.

Then they garnish with fruit that looks like it was cut a week ago. Take a good look at the brown dried edges on the limes and tell me that's what you want on your drink.This wasn't a fluke, it was like that for 3 visits now. 

They have a niche market of tourists, hotel guests and other victims who keep them busy. But if you look around downtown there are far better options.
