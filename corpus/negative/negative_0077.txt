My husband and I were not fans and will never go back again. The ambiance was terrible. Too light and booths are low, I felt more like I was in a McDonald's than a sit-down restaurant. I could hear the conversations of my neighbors. The chips were cold and certainly not fresh tasting. The salad was nothing special. We didn't have utensils when our salad was delivered. I ordered a chicken chimichanga which tasted pretty good, but overall never would go back to again. Would take Del Taco over this place any day to save money for the same ambiance and food.
