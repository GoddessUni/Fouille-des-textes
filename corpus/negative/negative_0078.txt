Tonight was extremely disappointing. We were going out for an unhappy anniversary but none the less a celebration of life. Our server was young and did not get our appetizers out before our soup and salad. Once I remind her, she brought them out and it was not what I ordered. The avocado was missing from the roll but that came seperately after we had alreadly finished our app.  We all had two rounds of drinks that took forever to refill - I had to find her in the server station. Last but not least, we had the most rude and unenthusiastic hibachi chef who slammed the food on our plates and couldn't care less about entertaining us or doing his job. We asked him his name and he responded with "jerry."  The next time we celebrate my dad's favorite meal, we won't be going here.
