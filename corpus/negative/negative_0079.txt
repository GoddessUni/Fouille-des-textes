I have never had a worse brunch experience. 

We went for Easter brunch and it was early. They didn't appear very busy, yet it took 45 minutes to receive the first course. The food was bland and I was disappointed that they did not disclose that the fish was whole (I don't enjoy picking all the bones out personally). I left hungry and that never happens in New Orleans. Also, the neighboring table arrived after us yet kept receiving their food first. Well before us, in fact. They were finished with their dessert by the time we got our entree.

I always leave plenty of time for brunch before making other plans, and this is the first time we really had to rush because everything took so long. It wasn't worth the wait.
