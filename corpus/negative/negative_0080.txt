Anyone who thinks this place deserves more than 2 stars has not eaten good Pho. If all you want is fast and cheap then it's fine but with that you get poor service and bland food. For the very first time in all my Pho eating days, I did not finish my Pho. It tasted like hot water poured over some meat, none of the complex flavors I'm used to in even average Pho joints. No amount of Siracha or hoysin could save it.
My wife had the Com Ca Ri Ga. She asked for it to be spicy. The response was "No". While the chicken itself was tasty, the curry was more like stew. 
Pick any other Pho joint in the neighborhood and you are sure to do better.
