The service was extremely slow, our appetizer order was wrong, the waiter had to come back to the table to have us repeat our entree order because he forgot it before entering it into the computer, we had to request napkins and silverware to eat our food, we had to request drink refills, and it took twice ordering coffee before it was ever brought to the table!

Then, when we had all we could take, we had to walk over to the pay station (not a front desk but the waiter's pay station) to get and pay our bill. Before leaving we heard him asking another table to repeat their entree order and by that time it was the only table in his section he had to worry about.

Definitely never returning!
