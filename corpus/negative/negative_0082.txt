Our wait was double the time we first were told. Waitress when we sat in lounge passed by is 3+times offering other adult only parties something to drink but our family of 4 not once even looked out. After peeking at their list I saw 5 parties that were seated before us, they totally skipped my name. No apologies since of course they are doing us a favor right?!  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I ever have experienced. Lived in three different states and have traveled a lot these clowns took the cake. Needless to say we ended up going elsewhere, my regret was waiting as long as we did. Kids didn't end up eating until 8:30p.
