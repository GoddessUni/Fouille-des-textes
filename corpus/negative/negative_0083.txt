I worked in the restaurant industry for 8 years while in high school and college.  Along the way I came in contact with many different managers.  None of which acted as rude, argumentative, or plain ignorant as the manager of this terrible pizza joint.  They made a simple mistake and I called him on it.  He immediately became defensive and screamed at me over the phone.  The last comment is definitely a response to the previous review which calls the resurgent on my same complaint.  My advice for the owner...get a new manager and see your business boom.  I have many friends and relatives in Medford and this will absolutely be a topic of conversation when discussing the worst of the worst.
