After paying nearly $10 to park, we went to the rooftop to have dinner. We were told by the bartender we can either approach the bar to order or if we want a server he can call down for one. The server came and greeted us, took our drink order and brought us waters. In the meantime a large group came in with a riverwalk tour and was greeted with pitchers of sangria. After nearly 15 minutes of waiting on the drinks we ordered, we watched a table who sat down after us get their drinks. We waited a few more minutes and when the server didn't return to our table we decided to leave. We passed our server on the way out as she was bringing bottles of water to the large group and told her we were going to head out. Ps she still didn't have OUR drinks. She apologized and said she got caught up. This was our first time to the new spot and we live in downtown. All I can say is, we may not ever be back if this is normal service for the new establishment and I MISS FLY BAR.
