The beers here are great!

However my review is about the food. I ordered the Shepard's Pie and although they said it is their version of it. I was not expecting stew with mashed potatoes on top. As a stew it was pretty disappointing. Shepard's pie is usually made with ground meat, beef or lamb. Great basin said they use lamb and what I got was chunks of something that wasn't lamb. Tasted more like beef or could have been mutton. The sauce was flavorless and between the meat and sauce the dish was a bust.

At our table we also ordered the garlic fries. What a rip off. A tiny portion with dried garlic sprinkled over the top.

In summary, great beers. Food and service so-so.
