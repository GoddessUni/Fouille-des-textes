New Orleans restaurants were begging to open back up, but yet you don't care about the public. With everything going on of course people are going to be watching your every move but obviously the hostess at Frey's doesn't care matter fact when I said I wouldn't return she said "that's fine". ( the girl with the green highlights at the front). Covid or not when I order a to go order I don't want to return with my food sitting by an open door as well as another customer. The hostess was just chatting away. The man had a brown paper bag all stapled nicely for his to go order. She saw me and she saw the food but continued to talk. When he left I asked was that open container food my order and she replied yes. I told her I didn't want the fries considering they were just sitting there for the time she was chatting and who knows how long it was there before I arrived. She said it had to sit there because she was the only one there and she was busy. She was never apologetic nor did she sympathize with the fact that she had a paying customers food just sitting there opened fries by the door. She was rude and very unprofessional. The cook from the back was the only helpful person in the matter. But your hostess doesn't care about your business because her attitude is "that's fine" when she messes up and loses business.
