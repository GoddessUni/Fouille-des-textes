The food here is good and plentiful. It has always come out hot and prepped well. Good salad and excellent bread. Our problem with this restaurant is the cleanliness and service! On several occasions we have been seated at tables that still have crumbs on the table, and it would be nice if they were to remove the glass tops and clean them thouroughly once in awhile. The floors are old, from the original bank, which we like but look very dirty. Our daughters family ate here about 2 months ago and saw mice run across the floor by the baseboard. They won't eat here again! CLEAN THINGS UP! We had a server whose name was Cooper I believe, that while talking to us used profanity and was unprofessional. He should remember that he is the face of the restaurant to us that night! And last but not least as we walked to our car we observed our server thru the window vaping in the kitchen right next to the people preparing the food. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE AND SHOULD BE LOOKED INTO BY THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT! In summary we like the food and service is good on some nights, but the restaurant needs to be cleaned up and a closer eye kept on the everyday running of this decent local restaurant. We love the local vibe but not sure we can go back.
