We visited this location on a Monday afternoon. It was something we saw on the Food Network and were very excited to eat here. We got there and there was no AC working, it was hot, super hot. It's not appealing to eat a big, hot and heavy meal when you're sweating and hot. We ordered our food and sat in a booth by the bar. There were some locals who had seemed to have been there a while and were being quite loud and rambunctious. It was rather annoying. Then, the bartender turned the stereo up so loud we couldn't speak to the person across from us. Only got louder when the drunk people at the bar took the opportunity to belt the tunes out at the top of their lungs. I'm all for having a good time, but this place is small, and kind of pricey for a hot dog, it would be nice to at least have the opportunity to converse with the people you are having dinner with. Our food came and was tasty. I have a seafood / shellfish allergy and standardly have ran into no issues while in the Quarter. My boyfriend ordered the crawfish dog, and I'm assuming that they cooked them on top of each other because I had a really bad allergic reaction to my beef dog. I can't place all of the blame on them for this, I should have spoken up while placing the order. Just beware that your food will come in contact with many things and if you have issues with anything on the menu speak up. This place has potential but when visiting the Quarter there are a lot of amazing places to eat, sadly we won't be visiting  Dat Dog on our next trip in.
