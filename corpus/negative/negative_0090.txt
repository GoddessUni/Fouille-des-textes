Too bad. I do like Montana's but not sure what happened here. We sat down and waited almost 1/2h for a menu and someone to take a drink order. 
Ok, so maybe we slipped between the cracks and it will get better. Nope. Drinks showed up fast. Was an other 1/2h till we asked for someone to take a food order (felt like we were inconveniencing the server) an other lady came over and took our order. She was super nice and we thought it was going to be better. Nope. Over 1/2h again for a burger (for me) and salad (for my wife), maybe they were slammed inside (we were on the patio) Nope. Sparsely seated inside. WT_? When we talked to our server she apologized and told us "this is par for the course." I'm happy we weren't in a hurry (had movie tickets or something else) 

I'm sorry Montana's but you missed the mark when you are in a service industry. Would of got more bang for my buck and much better service at Tim's.
