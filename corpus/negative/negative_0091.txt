I know Pancake Pantry is a staple of the Nashvillain touristy breakfast stops- but I gotta say... its just not THAT great.  The line around the block is off-putting and the service is pretty brash... the main goal is to get you in and get you out and this is definately made obvious by the servers...

Food-wise they have pretty amazing sweet potato pancakes that are really pretty righteous... but not good enough to justify the line around the block- or the hassle of going there.  

When I first moved here, it was a spot we went to regularly- but to me now it is clearly a tourist stop to be avoided.
