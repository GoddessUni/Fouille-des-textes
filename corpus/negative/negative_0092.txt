Ugh.  I gave this place a few chances, but I will not be coming back.  First of all - the place itself, tucked in the neighborhood, within walking distance, not on Main St, so much going for it.  But when you walk in - what the heck? The "lobby" is weird, dark and cluttered.  There are wires or extension cords running along the ceiling and I swear a washer/dryer set with a laundry basket of dirty linens on top.  Obviously a converted house, but this is ridiculous.  

Everyone goes here for the endless margaritas and the outside patio but the margaritas are a watery mix and served in wine glasses(?). There are no margarita glasses to be found at this place.  I don't even think they came with a fresh lime.  The outside patio is a plus but with food and drink this bad, I'm disappointed to say I won't be using it.

I ordered enchiladas and they were awful.  There was something dusted on the top and I asked the server what it was and he looked at me with a straight face and said, "parmesan cheese."  

That about sums it up.
