Terrible service...brought crab legs without a cracker..half the meals came so much later that the first half of our group of six were nearly done eating. Then we ordered a burger off the reg menu rather than the kids so she could have it cooked medium and it was beyond well done. Hers of course was one of the later entrees to show up so by the time they remade it...the timing was ridiculous. We had three servers at our table including the manager and still couldn't get water or refills. My mother did like her crab legs which is the only reason I rated 2 star!
