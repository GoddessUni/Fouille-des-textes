I'm staying at the Hyatt and got some room service- Keating's River Grill is the restaurant of the hotel.

I got the corn chowder and the whole wheat penne- a $30 meal that I would pay less than $3 for. 

The corn chowder had a film of oil on top that was atrocious. The flavor was not very good and really just not impressive at all. 

The whole wheat penne is awful as well. The pasta sauce is watery, the vegetables are overcooked and the meal in general was lacking in flavor!

I had a few bites of each and didn't touch the rest. 

I am hoping that the restaurant is better than the room service, but seeing as its the same kitchen, I highly doubt it.
