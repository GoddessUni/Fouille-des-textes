had the worst experience here! these people are scamming people. do not support them. my car was booted along with about 10 other people right before thanksgiving. on the left side of the building they're no visible signs that say EL PATRON CUSTOMERS will be booted. i was picking up my food and in 5 minutes they booted my car.

there is a sign that says "private property. customers only." i am a customer! they don't make it clear to who and who cannot park. the only sign on the left side of the building that tells you you can't park there is hiding behind a pillar. when i told the manager he balmed it on the girls working in the front. this establishment should be ashamed of themselves for ripping off good customers. i had to pay $90 to get it off 
people who can sit here and rip people off have no morals. them and the towing comany is definitely scamming. 
watch out if you go here
