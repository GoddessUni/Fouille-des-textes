Horrible server who took forever to even greet our table, made rude comments when asked about menu items.  Ordered a medium-well burger, which was cold and raw in the middle.  Tried flagging down other servers since ours was missing...again.  Looking around, there were only four tables occupied on a Tuesday night, so where he was hiding IDK. I was starving after a full day of classes, so ate the fries and edges of the burger that were at best medium-rare.  I have a picture, but this app doesn't have an option to attach it.
Finally got the manager and asked for a resolution.  They didn't charge for the crappy burger, his excuse for bad service was that the server didn't like one of the people in our group.  Mind you the person they didn't like had ordered the most expensive steak dish and had purchased two bottles of wine.  Not sure how that was offensive to the server, maybe because it entailed some effort.
I have never been back, and won't return.
