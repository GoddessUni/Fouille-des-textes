As many stated, don't come here for the customer service.... because you won't find a lick of it. I don't care though. Came into this with very low expectations. They're everywhere though so I figured we should try it. 

First impression of the pizza was it looks insanely greasy and just plain weird. The cheese looks funny on the pizza. My sons first comment was on the thickness. If you think you've had thin pizza before, think again. We held it up to the thickness of the cardboard box it came in and they're literally the exact same size. Quite unimpressive for an $18 pizza. 

Second impressions aka the taste. My son had one piece and wouldn't eat anymore. I love pizza. Any kind, from nearly everywhere. It's my favorite food. Even I was less than happy with the flavor. The crisp crust is nice, sauce was good (but so little of it because of how thin it was), but the cheese was the breaking point again. It tastes gross. Both on the cheese and pepperoni. Pepperoni was definitely better though. Just imagine the worst quality cheese available in the country, process it a few more times, and you'll get the cheese they use (if it's even real).

I don't think I'd ever order from here again. I always encourage everyone to make their own opinions though! So go try it for yourself. Just make sure you have back up dinner plans.
