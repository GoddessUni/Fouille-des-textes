We go shopping in Indy every 4 months or so and always make The Cheesecake Factory our go to. Yesterday as I sat smelling sour smelling floors, swatting away gnats, picking hair off my napkin, and trying not to look too closely at the dirty floors and spotty flatware, I began to wonder why. It's not just a staff shortage which I give a lot of slack for. It's been this way for quite awhile and I'm not sure why I keep going back.  The crispy crabs bites were really good. My chicken and biscuits meal featured dried out biscuits and overcooked chicken. My daughter got the Cajun pasta which she liked. We skipped dessert. Our waitress was pretty good, but the overall quality and shabby appearance if you look closely enough,  can no longer be ignored by me.  I won't be back.
