Visited this location today 10-5-2018, 12:32pm to be exact.  The drive through lady was a totally unprofessional, rude, condescending.  I have never experience this from this location until today.  Have been going there for years.  NO MORE.  

She asked what I wanted to order, I told her what I wanted, she said in smart tone, can you just repeat so I won't have to ask you again!!

This hit a red button and I repeated what I wanted, combo or single priced, I don't care, just get me my order, then she said, well I don't care either.  

Apparently she seems to get away with this.  At this point I told her forget it, she then said you can go down the street, I don't care.

The next review after this one will go to corporate.  Clearly some of these employees need people skills training.   Won't waste any of my money at this location again.
