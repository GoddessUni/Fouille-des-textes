Oh no Noorish......

I was enthusiastic when this place first opened, and found the food to be absolutely delicious. However, after a few subsequent visits, I'm afraid I have to write another (not so glowing) review.

First of all, I swear that the Bodhi Burger has shrunk. The patty was significantly smaller than it was the first time I went, which is a little insulting given that the price is still a whopping 18$. My friend ordered an eggplant & mushroom concoction that was truly horrible. After ordering two drinks, two entrees, one single chocolate piece ($2.50 a pop) and a teensy banana dessert, our bill came to $58.00!!! Yowza!

The service was bizarre, to say the least.

It's sad - I think the idea of this place is fabulous and, even though it has shrunk, the Bodhi Tree Burger is still one of my favourite veggie burgers in the city. However, by charging these prices, you are doing nothing to dispel the myth that healthy eating is something reserved for wealthy, elite people. Sadly, I think I have been to Noorish for the last time....
