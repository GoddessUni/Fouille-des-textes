Really bad attempt at fusion sushi... I like Stephen Starr's other restaurants in Philly (especially El Vez), as well as Buddakan in NYC, but this is just a disgrace to sushi lovers.  I went here about a handful of times because friends wanted to try it out, but it was just bad food all around.  As a sushi enthusiast, I was really disappointed, especially since I lived right near here and SO hoped for Pod to be good!

The only good thing I can say about it is that the desserts are really unique and delicious, but skip the entrees and go straight for dessert!
