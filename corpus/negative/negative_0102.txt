"Weird Kroger" is pretty much the perfect term for this place! Their stock is really poor...for example they'll have like 5 kinds of Campbell's to-go soup out, and once those are gone they just seem to be gone. Same thing with sodas, salads, and other majorly popular stuff. It's like they have no idea they can just order more stuff the next time since they always sell out. 

I agree with Greg about the customer service. There is a serious lack of it here! For starters, you can definitely tell these people hate their jobs. They have this "save me!" look on their faces. Of course, I'm not sure why...I'd love a job where I could get paid to stand around, talk to my co-workers, and ignore customers. They're always huddled together up front. God forbid there be someone out amongst the isles in case someone needs help. In this store, it's your job to chase them down, and if you dare ask 

I've only been to Publix like 3 times in my life compared to the hundreds of times I've been to this Kroger, and in those 3 times I've been greeted and thanked more than I ever have here.

You basically go here because you need to either eat food or die. You don't go here because you want to or prefer to.
