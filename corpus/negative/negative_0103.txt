So I traveled for miles and way out of my way just to get a Salted Bagel with Lox, and of course the awesome Coffee Einsteins has.
So first off I'm very disappointed that at 10:30 am they don't have any Salted Bagels. Really that's your big seller! I highly doubt it..Second disappointment is when I sit down I notice that there is white onions on the Bagel and Lox when there should be Red onions or what I know them as Bermuda Onions. I mean yeah it's defiantly a good sandwich and the Lox is Fresh and non fatty and the sesame bagel is fantastic
by this point I solderer through it and take the nasty Onions off after a couple of bites.
  The sad thing is Einsteins does make the best Bagel and Lox in my opinion, I've had it at other places and they don't compare.
I put 2 Stars because they have done better.
