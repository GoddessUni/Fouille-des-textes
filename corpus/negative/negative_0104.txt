So this is my second time at Melt Shop since their Grand Opening almost a month ago and they are still trying to figure things out. Downloaded the app which featured a 4.00 off reward, arrived with our QR codes and the cashier had no idea what it meant or how to use it. It took three of them (a manager included ), two registers and fifteen minutes to figure it out. Precious time when you're on a work lunch break.

This time I ordered Mike's Hot Honey Chicken Tenders and my pescatarian partner had the plant based burger. He raved about the burger, very fresh and satisfying, my tenders were equally good but I expected a dipping sauce. I had to borrow one from somewhere else lol.  Then there were the drinks. His strawberry lemonade cost a whopping 2.99 and my small fountain drink 2.35. We both lamented on the fact that we could have gotten bigger drinks and free refills at Chick Filet not to mention the tenders which cost almost 9.00 for four would get you six at Chick as well.
