First of all, I'd like to make a comment on the composition of their menu. Reading through the menu, all of the dishes were made with pork except chicken adobo. There was also no veggie dish that could go with my meat dish...

We ordered their rib and a taco as starters. The rib was fried which I wasn't a fan of. The taco was soooo greasy that a lot of oil started dripping off...We ordered a new school dish (forgot the name) that came with shredded pork in shrimp paste, bitter melon and some green beans. The portion was so small that we had to order another entree.

We ordered flying pig and chicken odobo combo. Flying pig was way too sweet for my taste and covered with a big load of sauce. 

Also, they raised the price of the combo without marking it on their menu which I thought was shady. We both felt pretty nauseous after the dinner probably due to the grease...
