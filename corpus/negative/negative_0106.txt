Being Asian and eating Asian food for the majority of my life I know I wasn't going to expect too much from this place.   I am no food expert but Was hoping for the best.....

The Sake: the only reason this place got a 2nd star
The Bao: we got the pork belly.  Not impressed as the pork belly is supposed to melt in your mouth, not be so chewy
The ramen: are you kidding?  Oily broth, thrown in beef that obviously wasn't marinated for more than 30 seconds. Was not good. 
The lettuce wraps: lettuce was fresh the bulgogi was average and can someone tell the cook that bugogi is not cut into tiny bits? 
The stir fry udon: could it be any oilier? And smothered in soy sauce or hoisin sauce or what ever it was 
Malaysia's most popular street fair: pretty much Lo mein and nothing to write home about.    

Sat outside under ceiling fans that didn't even work. They were nice to let us come inside after our appetizers. Food did take long get to us. And on a Tuesday night it was not busy.  

A definite skip for me.  I almost feel bad that this is being passed off as Asian street fare.  Then again, st. Pete is limited with Asian options and this is probably what people will think is good Asian food. SMH

If you are in the mood for Asian and you find yourself in the same area as Hawkers, tell yourself you want Cuban and go to Bodega.
