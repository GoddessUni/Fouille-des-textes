We ordered drinks, three appetizers, and six entrees. $$$ We ordered our main dishes, but one person in our party didn't receive his food. The waitress admitted she forgot to put in his order, somehow. She apologized and said it was coming soon. Two hours later, we had all eaten and even ordered extra alcoholic drinks because we were waiting for our friend to get his food. Eventually, most of our party had to leave. The waitress said she put the ticket in, but there were eight tickets ahead of it. ...How?? If you realize a ticket was put in 2 hours late, wouldn't it become the priority? We then talked to the manager (Rachel), and she said the waitress claimed that we said we no longer wanted the food. She said that she was sorry there had been a "miscommunication," and I said there had been a lie. We never claimed we didn't want the food--why else did we wait for two entire hours? The waitress lied, I said. The manager claimed again that it was a "miscommunication." (The waitress was named Kira.) So... if she didn't lie, and we did still want the food........ where was it? What caused the miscommunication? We wanted food. They never served it. Pretty cut and dry. Rude and slow and dishonest service all around. Food was also very average.
