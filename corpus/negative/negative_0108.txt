Rose is a Racist.  I stopped in because Stoney's was recommend by a friend.  I picked up a 6 of Robert the Bruce and a random IPA. After Rose checked out the previous customer, she finished telling her story about her recent car accident. The customer leaves. She then rings me up and looks me in the eye and says, "My friend and I are in love with the same person." Me, "oh?" Rose, "It is America. My friend has fought his entire life to keep immigrants out of this country.  His whole family has.  His ancestors started by fighting the Spanish."  Me, "That is quite a story."  I pay and leave. So everyone is clear, I am of Spanish ancestry. It did not feel welcoming, and it ruined my evening. You may do whatever you wish, but I will be recommending that my friends not go to Stony's.  Just ask yourself if you agree with this view and whether you are ok with turning a blind eye to bad behavior. Too bad, they did have a good beer selection.
