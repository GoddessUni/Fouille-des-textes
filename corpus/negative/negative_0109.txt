Atmosphere was nice and the sax player was a nice touch. With a limited menu you would think they would focus on quality - no so the Saturday evening four of us went. Wine list is strictly Italian - a little variety would be nice. We ordered what was advertised as cream of mushroom soup - none of us could find a mushroom in the spicy tomato based soup. It was good for what it was but we still aren't sure if it was actually mushroom soup. The meatballs were rubbery and coarse, lacked flavor unless you like fennel. Pasta was soft and over cooked. I love cheese but it was overdone and turned into a glob of congealed goo before I could eat it. The chicken was overcooked. The only favorable dish was my wife pork chop which she had no trouble with. My folks took us here after several good experiences, and were disappointed and embarrassed about the whole thing. 
With all the choices in Tucson I'm not sure I'm going back.
