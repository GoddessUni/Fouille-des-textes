We got there around 11 am on Friday I need to us the washroom . Gross It was not just the kind dirty from that day . Looks and smelled bad . As we were waiting for our food to come the staff let a old man with a beard light and smoked while wait for his wife to finish her meal . staff made eye contact and said nothing. This very close to my home and I like the food. But if this their  attitude out front what going on in the back . this use to be my Go To but now it's Stay Away Both my self and the person i was with also have stomach troubles about 8 hours later
