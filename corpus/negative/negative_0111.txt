Thoroughly disappointed with this place.  I'd heard from several places that this was the place in town to go if you love food and you love the 'real thing'.  Um...no...this place is definitely not the real deal.  And that's my biggest gripe with it.  

I love restaurants that are true to themselves whether they're opulent, slick & trendy, tiny hole in the walls, or bar food.  They just have to be true to their nature.  I took this place to be new & trendy.  The decor was nice, but it's all downhill from there.  The wait staff wasn't very knowledgeable about their alcohol or their cuisine.(!?!)  The food sounded great on the menu, but taste and reason when it hit your tongue just wasn't there.  It just left you with a feeling of either being fooled or being guided by the inept....maybe both.

Though if you don't eat a lot of great food you could let yourself get fooled by this place or you could recommend it to your fast food loving friends.....
