I would not recommend the meijer bakery. It was my friends birthday (on New Year's Day) and she had a rough year. We wanted to make her cake funny with a light hearted meme that read "beep beep you sad f#%*. Happy birthday!" Through this difficult times it was memes and baked goods that got us through. 

We asked the bakery if they could do this and the lady said yes. When she was done writing, the woman didn't even show us the finished cake. She taped the box shut and when I say tape I mean like multiple pieces of tape like we had to pry the thing open. Which when we opened it, it all made sense. It's because this lady who decorated our cake KNEW what she did. She knew she gave us an ugly cake. She knew. She could've showed us the cake and asked if we liked it but nope she already knew we wouldn't because she knew how much she utterly screwed up. 

In all reality all she had to do was scrape off the ugly and just start over but nope we took the ugly cake to our struggling friend and we started the new year with an ugly cake. The cake itself wasn't bad tho.
