Great product, but horrible customer service online!  I live in New Orleans and brought my mother some pralines once on a trip home back to Maine.  She LOVED them and I started sending her boxes of pralines for Christmas, her birthday, even Mother's Day.  The customer service in the actual Southern Candymakers stores on Decatur Street is awesome.  Over Christmas, the stores were busy so I ordered them off the website to be sent to her.  I sent her a 3 pound box and she was SO excited.  She told me last week, she needed more so I went on the website again and ordered her a 4 pound box.  I placed the order on 1/14 and paid $30 extra for 2 day shipping via Fex Ex.  The order wasn't even sent out until the 16th and when she finally got them today, they were peanut butter flavored, which she does not like.  When I ordered, it said, "You must choose a flavor".  Original was the first choice and that's what I checked off.  I called customer service, and the woman that I dealt with, Linda, should not be working with people.  She basically accused me of lying, saying there was no way that there could be a computer error when I ordered, even though the order info also said my mother lived in Gorham, Mississippi instead of Maine and my old phone number was on the order, which I had corrected..  I told her that I've been getting pralines from them for years and spending at least $100 every time.  She finally said if my mother sent them back (paying shipping out of her own pocket) they would send her the original.  I am so upset after being a loyal customer for 5 years that they I would be treated so poorly.  I guess I will have to find another company to spend $300-500/year on,which is too bad because up until today, I would have stayed a loyal customer and always highly recommended them.
