Typically this would be a review about the food, dining experience etc. However, I was told on the phone to call back in 20 minutes to place my Carry out order because they were short on cooks. Interesting..... i wasn't sure I heard that right so I clarified. Are you saying you do not have enough cooks to take an order? She said YES- so you are turning away business? YES.
Which leaves me with a few more questions such as why did you answer the phone then? Or even better How would waiting 20 minutes  improve your already dire staffing situation? LOL I was very thrown off by the 20 minutes. Brownsburg didn't need yet another pizza joint....but I'm hopeful they will figure it out and maybe I'll give them another try in 20 weeks.:)
