Just had dinner at Elements.   Starting with the hostess the staff seems disjointed.  It turned into a rocket science discussion on where we would be seated.  Then the waiter did not present the menu at all.  Just basically asked what do you want to order.  I had the elk which was a beautiful dish and my husband had the lamb dish which was sparce.  Then we decided to give the bar a chance.  Very limited knowlqedge on mixing drinks and I ended the evening paying $6 for a bottle of spring water when all I wanted was a glass of perrier .  Staff needs major training and supervision
