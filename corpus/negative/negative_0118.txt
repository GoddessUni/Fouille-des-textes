I have never been so disappointed in a restaurant. We had a large group, so we had to wait to be seated. That was understandable.  We ended up sitting at 3 tables of 5, again, understandable.  We got drinks fairly quickly,  but waited longer than normal to place orders.  Then waited FOREVER for our food.  Tables that came in after us were served first. We asked our waitress about our food, as the other tables in our group were almost finished eating.  We were told there were 3 tickets ahead of us.  The manager came over and explained there had been a problem in the kitchen and he would comp our drinks (2 small beers, 1 drink and 2 pops) and take 15% off the bill.  Glad he at least addressed the issue, but he never came back to check on us.   After waiting another 15 minutes our food came out...lukewarm to cold!  He's lucky he didn't come back because he would have gotten an earful!  I had the sloppy joe hot dog.  Cold! The fish tacos were cold and the sloppy joes were lukewarm.  The waitress was nice, apologised and offered to nuke the food.  No thanks.  By that time I was disgusted and done with the whole place.  Granted, it was busy, but I guess the kitchen was not equipped to handle a rush in the off-season.  Lack of good restaurant management and perhaps an inexperienced kitchen crew.  Having worked in restaurants, I usually give them the benifit of the doubt, but this was just plain awful.  We won't be coming back.
