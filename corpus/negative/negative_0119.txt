I have been a regular at Bucca Di Beppo for the past 11 years.  When we lived in the Jax,Fl area we dined at the So. Side location, near the Avenues Mall.  This has been the place we take friends and family on special ocassions and love to have a romantic meal with my husband, just the two of us as well.  Recently, we moved to Riverview and were happy to have a "Bucca" near us.  On the Saturday before Father's day we took our party of 11 to celebrate.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  I ordered the Chicken Marsala and it was heavenly, the mushrooms were sauteed to a golden caramel color, then mixed with the Marsala sauce.  As usual, the small portion was still large for me, so I shared with our guests who vowed to order it on their next visit.  My husband was away and arrived on Sunday.  I mentioned that I had enjoyed the best "CM" on the previous day and he wanted to try it as well.  We ordered our drinks and our meal.  When the order arrived, instead of Marsala, I had Chicken Parmegian.  I do not enjoy breaded meals and rejected it,  the manager came, apologized and offered some complimentary drinks.  We still decided to wait for our Marsala.  When it finally arrived, it had nothing to do with the previous day dish.  it was a poor resemblance.  I inquired if they had a different cook and was told that indeed it was.  I did mention that while it was edible it was not as delicious.  Then came the bill and  there were charges for both entrees and the comp. drinks as well.  I spoke with the server who removed the charges.  She offered to pack the rest of the meal "to go" and we accepted.  It all sounds normal, right?  WELL, NOT SO, i PUT THE MEAL IN THE FRIDGE AND TODAY I WANTED MY SON TO TASTE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SUNDAY AND SATURDAY'S MEALS AND TO MY SURPRISE.... THERE WAS A PIECE OF THE CHICKEN PARMEGIAN!  Normally I would have let this one go up to the point of the bill and all, but TO PUNISH ME WITH SOMETHING THAT I HAD REJECTED?  SORRY BUCCA, BUT UNLESS YOU TEACH ALL YOUR COOKS TO PREPARE THIS DISH THE EXACT WAY THAT JASON (this is the chook I was told worked on Sat.) i will not be able to give you a good review.  I felt cheated...and I was.
