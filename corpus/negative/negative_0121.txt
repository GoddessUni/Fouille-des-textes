This is one place that while it has fair food, you should avoid.

First of all, it is not a typical place to get food or drink. Depending on the night, if you want just food or drink, be prepared to provide a cover. Yes, a cover BESIDES the food or drink you may order. Do not consider this as a restaurant or a place to just grab a late night snack.

With that said, the food is fair to decent. The build your own burgers do give you a lot of options and flavors. The service is hit-or-miss, again, depending on the night and the management is not a lot of help not really seems to care when a complaint is made.

I ordered an Angus burger and it was made correctly and tasted right. When time came for dessert, I ordered one and wanted a-la-mode. The a-la-mode charge was $4 because they charge you as a separate ice cream order. Keep in mind, you only received one scoop. When I asked management about this, he basically told me this is how it is and basically could care less. 

Bottom line: If you can go in the middle of the day when it is not crowded during the week, a decent burger is in store for you. Any other time, it is like gambling in a casino and as they always say, the house never loses, but you will.
