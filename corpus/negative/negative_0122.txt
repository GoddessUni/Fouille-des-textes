5 stars for the food
1 start for...everything else, so average it to 2 stars overall. 
We felt very uncomfortable: cheap chairs, bad location, table was dirty (they had to wipe it while we stood there awkwardly and then it had to dry), open restaurant set-up so everyone can see everything & you have to get up and order your food at the front and fill your own water or soda at a tall soda machine...again, where everyone can see you. That's all fine if that's the vibe you're doing, but then to have pretty expensive food which was SO delicious and then to be snobby when one person of our party asks to substitute something (cashier gives a deep breath, rolls eyes, and explains they are the "pizza gods" so they can substitute but don't like to). Ok ok....so you are fancy and snobby, then why am I eating this amazing food with the cheapest silverware and a thin paper napkin? Shouldn't I be experiencing luxury lighting, impeccable service telling me about the food and a freaking cloth napkin? Anyways, if you don't care about service, comfort, atmosphere, or any other thing about eating out, then go for it! OR, just get curbside pick up to enjoy the AMAZING food somewhere else that is comfortable and nice.
