This place look very nice and I read really good reviews about this place, we did not get a chance to enjoy it, just because we are Latinos and the old men at the door did not want to let us in just because that, he said we need a reservation but we called 1 hour ahead and they said we can just walk in because they have plenty tables. Well as soon the guy saw me he looked at me up and down and ask me what you want? (I just want to point out that My family and I we are well dressed so that was not the issue) he just discriminates us for being latinos, this person don't have no business working in a hotel where there is people from everywhere.
