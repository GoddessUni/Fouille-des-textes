This was my first visit to QDOBA, as I am a Chipotle fan who loves sofritas. I was happy to learn that QDOBA served the Impossible mock meat. Things started to go downhill quickly. There was a huge problem with the register. One of the employees saw me waiting for service and walked over to the counter. I had to repeat three times that I wanted a burrito. I then asked for the Impossible selection. She yelled over to the manager who was still attempting to solve an issue at the register. He nonchalantly stated that it would take 45 minutes for another batch. No sorry or anything. Terrible customer service and kitchen prep.
