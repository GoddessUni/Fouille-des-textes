The ambiance is awesome! That's it. The servers keep circling back like vultures even though your still eating and drinking and talking...She even had the nerve to pretend to check the glass to see if money or a card was in it. There was literally 2 other people in the restaurant! It was horrible! We were there's for less than an hour. They should just leave paying customers alone until we are clearly done. It's WAY overpriced and nothing special. The kale salad tasted like coleslaw. The fish and chips were drenched in batter and it was a small portion for almost $20! The sangria was way too sweet.
