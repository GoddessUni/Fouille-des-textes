If I could give 0 stars I would. My co-worker and I went for lunch at 1pm on a Wednesday. We were greeted promptly and seated in an empty dining room (well there was one lady in the corner). After 10 minutes or so, the waiter hollered from across the room and behind the computer terminal that he would be right with us and took our drink order from there - 2 waters. Another 10 minutes later he brought the waters and was prepared to take our order. Just before we opened our mouth to order a pizza, he says, "You're going to kill me and just leave... We are out of dough to make Pizza, Calzone, and Stromboli," giving an explanation of running out with a large corporate order of 250 pies. So after the initial shock, we proceed to order our 3rd choice (Calzone was the 2nd). Wait, they are out of meatballs for the meatball sub, too! At that point, we did leave. -- I remember overhearing the waiter explain to the sole lady in the corner being out of Honey Mustard dressing for her salad, too. -- HOW CAN YOU RUN OUT OF DOUGH WHEN "PIZZA" IS IN YOUR COMPANY NAME!!! Forget running out, HOW ABOUT TELLING YOUR PATRONS UPON ARRIVAL, NOT 20 MINUTES LATER!!! They not only ruined my plans for lunch, but reduced my lunch to requiring fast food bc of the time constraints, and I WILL NEVER RETURN vc of poor customer service.  Italian food is a dime a dozen, so Customer service should set it apart. NOT AT SALVATORE'S!
