Had a mediocre experience here, I order the ribeye medium well and my husband ordered the T-bone medium well also.  Both steaks came out rare, the waitress looked and both and said "oh those are super rare".  She took them back and told us they would cook them some more.  Well when they came out they were burnt, the steaks tasted awful, the chef overdid it.  So then the manager comes over and tells us that since we want our steaks cooked medium well they will come out charred...huh? So you can't cook a medium well steak without burning it ? What kind of steakhouse is this? I understand there will be some char but it should not taste burnt and disgusting! I asked him so did his chef know how to cook because that seems odd especially since I get medium well steaks everywhere I go.  So, they redid the steaks and again they were not medium well, he came to check on us and said that looks medium well to me. The entire inside was pink, I said that looks medium well ??! He said well it's not bleeding. I cut into the steak some more and what do you know, blood smh.  I sent it back and canceled my order, my husband kept his steak, it was not cooked right but it was not bleeding.  The manager had a whatever attitude, Poor service if you ask me for such expensive food.
