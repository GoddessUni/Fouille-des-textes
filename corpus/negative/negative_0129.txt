We discovered this place couple months ago.  First time was good food and good service.  Second time good food and bad service.  Today and what will be our final visit bad service just ok food.

They have a system that wait staff is not assigned specific tables but everyone responds to different table needs.  In other words there is no ownership of responsibility for a particular table or guests.  Today we were seated promptly but sat for awhile for order to be taken which was done by our first contact waitress. When order came by a new waitress we pointed out that the order was missing side of gravy and order of toast.  She brought gravy bur no toast.  Halfway thru breakfast we pointed out to yet another waitress we were still short order toast.  Yet another waiters. Brought toast that was not toast as the butter on the bread was not even melting.  Then we noticed the order did not have sour cream in the breakfast as the menu called for.  When I pointed out there or waitress said " oh sorry". Not can I get you some and hash browns were barely cooked.
Pointing this out at time of departure cashier while saying "oh sorry", did not even look at me and frankly displayed attitude so oh well.  Like I said lack of ownership or responsibility.  Many other places in town to go visit- sorry
