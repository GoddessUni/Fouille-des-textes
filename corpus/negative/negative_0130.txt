Been dying to try this place since we discovered it on Facebook! Finally went today on a Sunday evening with a rather large party.
Restaurant was cute, Western themed of course, very clean and we were quickly seated.
Service was fine, the waitress was attentive and friendly enough.
Food was just ok. I ordered a 6oz Sirloin cooked Medium with a side of Broccolini and Cheese. I aLso added Bone Marrow Compound Butter as an Enhancement. Presentation was lovely, my food was barely warm. The butter didn't melt as I put it on my steak and the cheese sauce on the broccolini was starting to separate. I prefer to not send food back, I'm sure they could have fixed it, but at this price point I expect it to be done well the first time. 
Everyone else in my party thought the food was good. No one else had issues with food temperature except my two year old niece. We ordered simple Mac and Cheese for her and it was steaming hot!! Not too big an issue, but we had to cool it down on a separate plate for her to eat.
We might be back to try again for a date night, but probably not for a such a large group again.
