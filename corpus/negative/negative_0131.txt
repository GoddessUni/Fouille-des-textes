Sunday August 17th, my family ordered the Sunday Special mentioned the Facebook promo, and made it clear we wanted the 2nd lb free as advertised. We were informed Jason's was out of rice and that beans would be substituted or we could wait 30 minutes for rice if we wanted and they were out of flour tortillas and all corn tortillas would be substituted. We told them that would be OK. When we got home we had 1 box of carne asade with 2 jalapenos in it, 2-16 ounce beans, salsas, a 2-liter of coke and only 5 corn tortillas. This didn't seem right so I weighed the carne asada it weighed 1.4lbs. Our order was short on tortillas, grilled onions and a whole 1lb of carne asada.
