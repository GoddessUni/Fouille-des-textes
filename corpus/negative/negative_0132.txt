As a rule I don't leave reviews but this is an exception to the rule. 

IT IS A CRIME THAT THIS PLACE EXISTS IN NEW ORLEANS!!!

it's fine for the rest of the country because you're used to subpar mediocrity but not in New Orleans please. This is the equivalent to the Disney-fication of Times Square in a city known for great food and even better times. 

The food was inedible and took anywhere from 45-60 minutes to be brought out. It's almost like they had no concept of timing the food to be up at the same time. 

My 9 year old said the pigs in a blanket (pretzel dogs in D&B parlance) we're terrible and couldn't eat them. How bad so hot dogs have to be for a 9 year old to not like them? I had a bite of a burger and it brought me right back to the lowest grade of institutional food, the type that the rumor is that it's "Grade D but edible". Waiter forgot one person's meal entirely. 

While I appreciate the jobs this company is providing to the community, I'd prefer it to shut it's doors and go away with it's proverbial tail between it's legs. 

Even if it's not locals and just tourists it should still be a crime because it tarnishes the New Orleans experience. The place can't fold up soon enough. It's fucking terrible.
