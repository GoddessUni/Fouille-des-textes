So totally disappointed in our stay. We flew up from LA for our anniversary for a few days in Santa Barbara. Bacara really let us down in so many ways. 

Cons:
- hard mattresses (literally woke up sore) 
- leaky bathtub so bad that maintenance came and had to look at it because it was leaking into the room below at 10 pm (really? 10 pm? yes at 10 pm they had to look at our bathtub at 10 pm on our anniversary night) 
- whoever was above us was pacing back and fourth at 7 am with their heals hard on the floor for over an hour (guest fault for pacing, hotels fault for thin floors and walls.)
- spa has no service (no servers to bring drinks or anything by the pool or anywhere in the spa)
- went to other pool and sat there for 45 minutes and not one server came to get us drinks (this is our anniversary) so we left. 
- lots of kids by all pools except the really bad spa pool, screaming and yelling (they're kids thats what they do but you should know about it before you make your decision to stay here, takes the romance out a little I would say)
- spa cafe was closed which was told to us was going to be open by manager when we checked in
- main dining area was closed for our stay due to staff shortage (so we couldn't eat dinner at their nice restaurant on our anniversary as planned) 
- only one out of 3 restaurants open (Bistro) which was ok
- concierge (Ryan), wanted me off the phone as soon as possible and was not even slightly helpful. He booked through the app open table (I could have booked a restaurant through open table, I wanted the concierge service, the connection phone call made to get us a sweet table, not an app reservation anyone with a cell phone could make for free. Isn't a concierges only job to leverage his connections and make guests stay better by actually helping them in a way they can't help themselves?)
- no one came to pick up our food tray after we called to have them take it away. It collected BUGS!
- sun deck of spa all you hear is traffic and an occasional train going by (not great) 
- no turndown service at all
- spa pool is so bad, it was like a condo pool servicing 200 condos (no luxury, very sad to see) 
- bees on the sun deck continuously buzzing and landing on us, lucky we didn't get stung
- airplanes flying low over pool and beach all afternoon (hmmm) airport approach  

Pros:
- ocean view and sound of the waves at night
- grounds are pretty 
- bottle of champagne for anniversary when we came in with a cupcake saying happy anniversary 

The final true disappointment was the manager who replied to this review. After I left this review the manager responded below promptly but never responded after that. She just wanted to look good on yelp to her boss and other potential guests. This really rubbed me the wrong way and added to my overall disappointment. Don't trust the responses they don't care. Our 1st anniversary and they didn't care. 

All in all very disappointed with this place. We canceled our spa appointments and checked out immediately. Called the four seasons and was able to get a room there and it's been great. 

Bacara you really ruined our stay on our first anniversary. I truly hope you correct your service issues for the sake of future guests.
