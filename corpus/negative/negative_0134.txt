Why this place exists at all is beyond me. I love Moroccan food and was promised a 7 course meal for a large birthday party. The food was awful, so was the service and the decor. Being in that place is so claustrophobic, it feels like being inside a cave. I love this type of decor, I went to a lot of Moroccan restaurants as well as some of its neighbors, like Algerian and Lebanese, Israeli and Egyptian. I've been to a lot of Moroccan place that are set up like cafes, inexpensive but very good food, cous cous dishes served in beautiful hand made clay pots, when you lift the lid, the aromas hit your nose and will make you salivate.
You won't get that here. The 7 course meal didn't materialize, we were given cucumber/tomato salad swimming in oil, an eggplant spread that was really mediocre, whole chickens to be ripped apart and eaten with our hands, a huge plate of greasy fatty mutton and that is IT!!! I left hungry. I had grease dripping all over me and they offered towels to cover our laps.

It was not cheap by any means. Why would anyone go here, is beyond me. oh and its  cash only, you would think they mentioned that when the reservation was made for 15 people? 


I am reading reviews and wondering, how come I didn't see any of this food. You know what, I don't think anyone who has been to Morocco or to a REAL moroccan restaurant can like this place.
