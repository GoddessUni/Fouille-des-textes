I have been a loyal customer at UBB for years, as I have been a student nearby. I have thoroughly enjoyed many a cup of coffee and several sweet treats there throughout my many visits there. However, recently, the customer experience has left a lot to be desired. I was recently approached there while I was studying, after I had just returned from placing my plate in the dirty dish bin provided. I had just finished a $6 slice of coffee cake that I had ordered fewer than thirty minutes prior. An employee asked me if I were going to order something, because the tables were "only for paying customers". After I explained that I had just finished something that I had bought, she asked if I was going to order anything else, because I was no longer a paying customer. After that interaction I just left. I understand that seating space is in very high demand, but I do believe there could have been a more tactful way for the employee to treat a loyal customer. Still love UBB coffee, but the customer service could be better.
