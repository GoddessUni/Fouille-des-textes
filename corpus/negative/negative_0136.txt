I'm a lover of Thai food and I love the numbing sensation you get in your mouth when you eat something awesomely spicy. I had a $10 dollar off coupon so I figured I'd give this place a shot. Kind of hole in the wall looking on the outside but the inside was decorated really cute. Purple walls and red tablecloths and not too many tables this place definitely had the mom and pop coziness feel to it. Now I don't remember the names of the dishes but I can however describe them haha. The first dish we got was a deep fried curry chicken for $8.95, the flavor was really good in this dish but the chicken was either extremely over cooked or they used a horrendous grade of chicken because it was pretty much impossible to take a bite off without looking like an animal. 
Next we were stuck between a M-word curry (sorry don't remember) and just a regular yellow curry, the language barrier was really hard to get by because when I asked what the difference was she just recited what was on the menu.. We ended up going with our gut and just getting the yellow ($14.95). The other main dish we got was  a crispy chicken with veggies and cashews ($14.95). We also got a rice for 2 at $7 which I thought was incredibly ridiculous for their dimes cost of rice.

Boy was it disappointing when these two dishes came to our table. The curry had separated from the HUGE amount of oil dumped in, I would say there was at least 2-3 tablespoons dumped right on top. The crispy "chicken" was just batter. I would say maybe 20% of the dish actually had chicken in it, and even with the bits of chicken all the oil and grease rushed into my mouth and made it completely unappetizing. The only thing that really saves face for this place was the service, constantly filling of our glasses and the flavor of the curry after putting yourself to shame and eating oil.
