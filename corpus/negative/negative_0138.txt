Went to Seahags with my friends on Sunday night. I ordered a burger and fries. The burger over done (asked for med) came out well but still was tasty. The onion rings and fries were great. I really enjoyed the seasoning or whatever was on the onion rings which were huge btw. Drink specials are every day which is a plus and our server LD was great. Perfectly attentive and I always had a full glass of water which was great in this FL heat. I heard they have all you can eat crabs on Mon and Tues nights. Definitely something I'm willing to try and I will be looking for LD that night! The decor in the place was odd but the outside bar is adorable. Could use a little revamp, but if you're quick american dinner/lunch this is the place you're looking for.
