I went there one night around 10pm on a friday night, thinking theyre obviously opened. I see people inside so I go to the drive through. I sat there for almost 15 minutes and finally went to the window. I see the manager in her office and I sit there waiting to see if maybe the machine is broken. I honk since no one wanted to give me any kind of attention, the manager ignores me. She the gets up 2 minutes later to walk to the window to just pick up the building phone and go back into her office, no eye contact. I call this tacobell and the line is now off?? I called coporate and they gave me a 2 free items from there, great. So I go back weeks later, wait another 15 mins at the drive thru and someone finally got to me. I gave them my coupon everything was fine. I come home.. they forgot one of my items I ordered for. I gave this place another chance and im done. Never going to this tacobell again.
