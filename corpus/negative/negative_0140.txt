Let me first say that I have never written a review before.  Another review on 9/8 mentioned their experience and I had to comment as well.  It was awful to see how the owner treated that table (we were seated next to them) - terrible customer service and complete disregard for health guidelines. 

More about the owner - he was walking around inside of the restaurant without a face covering, talking to both customers and employees (some of which also did not have masks on/weren't wearing them correctly).  As he was outside seating customers, he not only had his mask off, but was on the phone!  

I am only giving 2 stars for the bartender (Neil) and server (Sam) who were both very friendly.  The food was overpriced and bland.  The owner and some of his employees could clearly care less about the safety of their patrons.
