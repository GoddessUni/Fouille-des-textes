We were super excited to find out there was an Indian restaurant close to our apartment within walking distance, as me and my boyfriend love Indian food. Unfortunately we were disappointed with a below average meal. Naan and Veggie platter were average. Paneer Tikka Masala was below average - very oily on top and not creamy. We originally were going to go with hot level of spicy, but we were advised that it was very hot. So we went with medium level spiciness for both dishes. We should have gotten hot because there was barely any kick to it at all. Saag was also just average. Probably would not go here again.
