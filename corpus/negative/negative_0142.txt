Nope, not the place for a French dip sandwich.  The roll needs a hard exterior and no hot mustard made available.  Still trying to find a decent French Dip not some totally misaligned thing that bears no resemblance to a French dip.  

There out to be a law against advertising a French dip unless it actually has the right ingredients - sort of like bubbly wine can only be called Champagne if it comes from that region of France or like mezcal can only be called Tequila if it is grown and processed in Tequila, Mexico.

Truth in advertising is badly needed in this Idaho food marketplace.
