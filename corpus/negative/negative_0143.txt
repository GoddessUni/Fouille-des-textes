When this place first opened we visited often, and it was pretty good. We went back recently and it has not aged well. The place is in desperate need of an updating. Since they opened at least 20 places have opened within 10 miles and they have not kept up.
I must say the menu has changed somewhat over the years, but it's still primarily a pizza and pasta menu.
We visited at about 4 PM and were seated promptly in the bar area. There was only one other table we could see. The staff were mostly seated together at a table for what I assume was staff dinner. Our waiter approached and said he would be right back. When he did return, he took our drink order and then greeted the two women at the table behind us. They were obviously regulars as he spent a great deal of time fussing over them, unfortunately at our expense.
We ordered our meals. My entr√©e was supposed to come with soup or salad. I ordered soup which never came. I can only surmise that our waiter who was a little flighty, was too busy fussing over the two regulars to remember.
Our entrees arrived, Chicken Piccatta for me, a shrimp and strawberry salad for my dining companion. My chicken was okay, they could have been a little more generous with the sauce,  but the shrimp and strawberry salad was a disappointment, only 4 (count 'em 1, 2, 3, 4) shrimp a small bed of spinach and a few sliced strawberries for $12.99, a bit steep but a great profit item for the restaurant.
Since our waiter was, by this time, m.i.a. we couldn't complain. Water glasses remained unfilled until he reappeared to talk to the aforementioned ladies at the next table. 
A good waiter pays equal attention to ALL his tables, not just regulars.
The food was mediocre, the service indifferent and not well trained. I doubt if we'll be returning, given that there are at least 15 other chain restaurants within a 20 minute drive that do it better.
