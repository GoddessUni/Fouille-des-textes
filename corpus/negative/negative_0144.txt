Music was excellent and we found the group to be very engaging. This however was over shadowed by terrible table service. We were looking to purchase meals for 6 people which would have afforded the waitstaff healthy gratuity. We were not served for nearly the whole set and when we attempted to flag down a waitress we were told more than twice that they were not serving our table/off the clock now/ "I told her you're looking to order". Once we got our order in there were more issues from there. It truly felt like we were being an Inconvenience even tho this is the service experience they were offering all other patrons.  When our server could sense our frustration she began making excuses and searching for empathy. I was a server for 8 years I've been there and that's not how you handle that situation. Not great for groups not great for food. Drinks are below average but music was fine.
