Beautiful decor, service that is simultaneously haughty and indifferent, cuisine that ranges from delicious to inedible. Few veg options. Most menu choices heavy and non veg. I ordered an ice coffee and received an audible scoff and eye roll from the server. "Um, I could make you some coffee and put ice in it..." she told me. The coffee was only fair to poor.

My companion had to ask twice for a top-off on her coffee. This is unacceptable at any level of dining formality, least of all a pauncy concept-restaurant with special leather tables with rivets around the side.

I ordered the tofu scramble and it was terrible. Tasted of pepper and burnt cooking oil, bitter and slimy, with a mouth feel like curdled mucous with chunks of jello. Excellent cinnamon raisin toast, unremarkable hash browns. 

I can't remember the last time I sent a plate back at a restaurant, but I sent back the tofu scramble plate (although it was not cleared until much later.) It was taken off the bill.

My companion's biscuits and gravy were remarkably good, with chorizo and sweet potato biscuits. 

The decor is very self consciously tasteful, very attractive with vintage mirrors and a flat screen TV playing black and white movie classics with the sound off. Very warm and cozy interior decorating scheme that rather disappears up it's own ass with pretension, especially considering the "meh" quality of the service and cuisine. Also, was nearly dead empty on a beautiful spring Saturday afternoon around 230pm, so that's a red flag as well. 

If you want to spend money on a fancy breakfast, go to Day by Day.
