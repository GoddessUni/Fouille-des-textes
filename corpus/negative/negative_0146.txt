Rude! Rude! Rude!

So I've been here twice and as much as their food is OK as Jimmy John's goes, the employees are so rude, unfriendly, and act like you are an absolute inconvenience. The lady who was behind the counter today should never ever have a job dealing with people. No greetings as you come in, grouchy look on her face and stared me down while I looked at the menu that I felt like I should just run away freaky fast. Holy cow! I've never had such awful counter service in my life!

I ordered my usual Italian sub with some hot peppers and the woman making the sub made it fast and then handed it to me then the other one had me sign my receipt. No bags or napkins. Okay, great!

Overall, both experiences I've had here were some of my most uncomfortable moments.  I will most likely not be returning to this store and I most certainly do not recommend it.
