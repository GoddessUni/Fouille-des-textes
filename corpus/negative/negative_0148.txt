Ok, first, to call this place a German restaurant is akin to calling McDonald's a Scottish restaurant. Go to Dunderbaks if you want decent German fare. 

Arrived for lunch at 11:30am on a Friday. Not too terribly busy, maybe half full. No hostess but a gentleman told us to sit wherever we like. The tables in this place are odd. Many high tops, some couches with a coffee table as a table (really?), and a couch with 20 pillows on it that you have to move.  This place screams hipster. 

Waitress took drink order immediately and left and came back in 5 min with my drink, then took off. OK fine. 10 Min later she comes back to take our order. Simple food order, things that would probably take 20 min max to make right. WRONG. Sat there for 45-50 minutes without even a sorry your food is coming, or let me check on your food. Nope...the service here is absolutely awful! 

To whoever owns this place...you're going to go out of business quick if you have people leave after 45 min of ordering. I have seen a few other reviews on here that are similar to mine. Try harder or get out of the restaurant business.
