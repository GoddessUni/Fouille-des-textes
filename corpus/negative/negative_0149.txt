This used to be a great place for sushi and teppanyaki.  I placed a to go order for 4 items with the hostess. It took her 45 minutes to let me know she would be "bagging my order". I informed her that I had not seen the bill yet and she gave me a verbal total and a ticket with no dollar amounts, just the items.  I checked each  container to verify the order. One item was missing and two were wrong. How does someone screw up 3 out 4 items ordered? When I pointed them out, on one item she said, "well I didn't charge you for the extra" as if that makes it okay.  Between the poor service and the employee attitude I won't be going back. There are better choices in Tucson.
