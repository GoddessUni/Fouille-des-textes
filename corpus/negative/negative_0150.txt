Food was average this visit, so was the beer. 

A dishwasher or cook, stoned looking hippy, came by and asked what I wanted to drink right after I gave my order to our waitress and proceeded to get snappy with me about how he's trying to help out. Good for you shaggy, but I already gave my order once and don't appreciate the attitude. 

My buddy and I also ordered coleslaw as the sides for our meals. They brought out mac n cheese instead which has a surcharge. She said it was no problem and didn't want any of it to go to waste. Then the check came with an extra $7 in extras. Poor customer service and lack of communication. Don't appreciate the feeling that I've been swindled.
