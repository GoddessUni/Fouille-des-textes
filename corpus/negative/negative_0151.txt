Even though I go to Silvergreens relatively often -- mainly because it's probably the highest quality food in the open sewer that is Isla Vista -- I still dislike it greatly.
 
I have gotten food poisoning TWICE from this disgusting establishment, both times from raw spinach on their salads, which I will admit ARE very tasty. I find it UNBELIEVABLY disgusting that none of the employees wear gloves, half the time the kid at the register who handles nasty dirty money/cards is the guy who tosses the salads and manually assembles the sandwiches. 

I never see any of the employees wash their hands or even apply a squirt of Purell. Beyond disgusting, no wonder their salads have poisoned me twice.

Also, they are the most overpriced restaurant in Isla Vista with the smallest portions. The food tastes good, sure, but not all of us starving students can afford to plunk down 10 bucks on a SALAD.

I only eat here because I'm basically forced to, but I don't recommend it to anyone.

They get points for good quality food and having some decent vegetarian options, but it's still disgusting that no one there wears gloves.
