I would recommend that no one EVER go to this place. My last two times absolutely nothing was right with my order. But I was in a hurry today and they were convenient so I thought ok I'll try one more time. Ordered a 3 pc. chicken strip with a small fry. Opened the bag to a mess of cold nasty greasy fires in a box that looked like it was fished out of a dumpster. The chicken? Three tiny pieces that were less than 3" long and it was just mainly some breading (again cold and greasy) with maybe one tiny little strip of chicken. Totally disgusting and gross.
