Went for lunch. Had to flag someone down to seat us...flag a waiter to wait on us. Once we ordered, our food was delivered quickly to our table. I ordered the southwest salad. Chicken tasted like it had been prepared the day before and there was very little dressing on it. Had to flag waiter down for more dressing...then flag him down for our bill. He never once came to our table after we ordered to check to see how things were. Not impressed with my heaping bowl of lettuce and old chicken and TERRIBLE SERVICE! Will not be going back.
