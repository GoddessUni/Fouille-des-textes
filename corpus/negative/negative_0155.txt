By far the worst Mexican food in town. My family stopped by the other night to try out this new place right down the street. We were the only ones in and we're greeted and sat promptly. The chips came first but no drinks for at least 10 minutes. I ordered the carnitas and my wife and son ordered cheese enchiladas. The carnitas I had were terrible. They were very dry and not edible. Between the fat and dried up pork over 3/4 of the plate of pork wasn't edible. I ate some of the beans and rice which were ok. The enchiladas were dry and thin with very little filling. My son had a bite and wouldn't eat anymore. My wife suffered through the bites as she was hungry. At the end we told server about food and instead of taking the carnitas off he discounted $2.00 from the meal. I basically paid $12.00 for beans, rice, and the 1 taco that I was able to scrounge up from the fat and grissle on the plate. I felt very ripped off and taken advantage of when I paid. Terrible food and experience. Will never go again
