This location is the ONLY one I have a problem with and it seems they are doing everything in their power not to work and try to reject all customers. We are just coming out of Lent where we can't eat meat on Fridays. My favorite go to meal is the BK Big Fish. I went to this location at 10:05pm and no one answered the drive thru, I pull up and the workers are inside cleaning. I knock on the window and an elderly woman says they are closed. Mind you the hours of operation is on the same window and says 1am. She says "oh well I don't know why that's there, we close at 10". The following week I get there at 9:02pm, and no one again answers the drive thru. I pull around and knock on the door, they talk through the door and say they are closed. I AGAIN point to the hours of operation, and they all look at me like a deer in headlights. So last week it was 10pm, this week is 9pm. Fast forward to 3 weeks later to this morning. I order breakfast through UberEats at 9:32am, Burger King Cancels the order completely. What The Actual F%&* Is Going On With This Store?!?!? Are you guys trying not to keep customers? Is the new slogan "Burger King you can't actually have it your way, nor do we feel like working, Go to McDonalds from now on"
