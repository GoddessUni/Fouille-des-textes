I was going to buy lunch for my office to say thank you for the previous month's good work.  My newest employee suggested trying Bagger Dave's and printed off the menu.  After agreeing on our desitination, we ordered our food for take out:  this review is solely based on my experience.

I ordered the Tran Wreck Burger and the Santa Fe Nachos.  First the burger:  terrible, absolutely terrible.  The "thing" was soaked in over buttered onions, so if there was seasoning on the burger patty, or the fries, it was instantly washed away.  Took two bites and threw it away.  After I finish this post, I am going to go to McDonalds to buy a double cheeseburger in order to wash out the taste of Bagger Dave's offering.

The nacho's were regrettable.  The chipotle sauce was only on the bottom, there was maybe, just maybe, a table spoon of cheese trying to hold the chips together and the pico was a translucent mess that clearly should have been thrown out yesterday.  I order the diced chicken over the "messy Dave's BBQ" and got inch cubes of seasonless poultry:  on the plus side, it was cooked nicely.

I feel as though I should reimburse my own office the money that was paid for this meal.  The fact that this "chain" has multiple locations makes me worried that the stupid people may be winning the war.
