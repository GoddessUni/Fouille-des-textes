I am not in the habit of gratuitously slamming restaurants on Yelp but...

Four friends and I had one of the worst service experiences we've ever had a restaurant at this place. We showed up on a Saturday, with reservations. We waited for several minutes before we were seated and then waited another twenty before our waitress stopped by to take our order. Entrees took over an hour to come out. Clearly there were some major kitchen or service issues that night and our server's solution to dealing with this problem was to just ignore our table. No once did we get an apology or even the suggestion that anything might be inappropriate about our dining experience.

The meals ranged from 'ok' to 'really good' but there is no way I would put up with the awful service again.
