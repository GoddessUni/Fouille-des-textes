I do not recommend this establishment. Since this one is really close to my home, we have ordered numerous times and the quality is extremely inconsistent. This is the 3rd time, which will probably be our last, that the food was lacking in flavor for one. The portions were very small (previous times the portions vary- but half the amount?) The meat in the burrito was minimal at best. It was mostly rice and beans. I requested jalapeños and received one jalapeño slice?! Really?! I have ordered a combination plate in the past and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce out of a can and it was cold! Needless to say it went in the Garbage and we tried sticking to carnitas plate or burritos. Unfortunately today was the worst. In addition to all of that, waited for quite some time for my order and I was missing extra items that I paid for - again not the first time. There are many other Mexican restaurants nearby, I will be spending my money there.
