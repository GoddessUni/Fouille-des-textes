On Dec 29 @12:05 pm I stooped by To get a burger and my fav cheesy tots. The lady Lashunda Seals  at the register did not want to work today. My order was short and the guy threw my order back and told the elderly lady the order was short. So I said don't worry I'll take what she fixed just give me a refund for what I didn't get. I took a sip of my drink and it tasted like straight up carbon. I told the lady at the register and she frowned at me and then told the guy what I said and he shrugged his shoulders like so what lady get out of here. No one attempted to taste the drinks on the drink machine and see what needed to be corrected. Then she wasn't going to refund me my money I had to ask and she still had a attitude. She didn't apologize or nothing. I noticed her actions with other customers and was not interactive nor greeting customers nor thanking customers. I just didn't feel welcomed here today.
