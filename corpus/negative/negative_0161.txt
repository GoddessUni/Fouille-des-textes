"Do you want it Mike's way?". That was the cryptic way the visit started. " Mike's way?" I inquired, " This is my first time here I don't know what..., "Mike's way!" The server insisted, franticly waving her hand over the assortment of toppings like some mad magician. Then I got it, she wanted me to choose my toppings. Not unlike the scene in Ghostbusters where you had to choose the form of The Destructor. Although in Ghostbusters they were much more friendly about certain death.

So as you can tell the visit did not go well. I found the 2 servers at the counter to be rude, uncaring, robotic in a acerbic way, and totally without any sense of customer service.

I ordered 3 different subs. All were prepared with equal lack of thought or care to detail. I was taken back by the lack of variety in the way the subs could be prepared. For instance we usually get one of these subs/ hoagies toasted at other places but here they are not able to do that, not even toast the roll even though there was a hot flattop sitting there vacant of any use at the time. 2 of the subs were to have 3 different types of meats on them, when we got home and ate them we realized that the only meat on them was ham, that's it. 

We have many great sandwich shops in our area to choose from but we thought that we'd give this place a try. One strike, they're OUT! 

This place is the epitome of corporate flavor in restaurants: rushed, bland, too much hype. 

In summary I would avoid this place no matter the time, day, year, if you just came back from a deserted island, well you get the picture.
