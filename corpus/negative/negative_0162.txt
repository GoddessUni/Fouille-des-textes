There are so many diner options in the area, and this is one of those diners we just never have visited and I don't know why, as we drive by often on our way to other diners!

Hubby and I tried the Eagle for breakfast on New Year's eve morning.  The place was busy for a weekday morning, but then again this was a holiday for lots of folks.  Menu is good and has something for everyone.  We both got a combo breakfast that included eggs, meat, pancakes and coffee/juice.  The eggs/meat were fine, the pancakes were dry, bland and even though I saturated them in syrup just to get some flavor, it didn't help.  The coffee here was also very weak and has little in the way of flavor.  

I will say the service is excellent, the place is very clean and run efficiently.  That said, the breakfast food is better at other area diners, so maybe I'll try the Eagle again for lunch or dinner.
