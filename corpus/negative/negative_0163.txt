I gave this 2 stars but if I could have done 2 and half I would have. The place is very modern looking and had an overall good ambience.  The food was also very good. My husband had the #12 and I had the fried rice. I took my husband here because he loves Pho and Vietnamese food. I am more of a novice to this type of food. 

The service here is the reason why I did not rate this location well. The hostess was prompt and friendly and the food came out quickly...that is the only plus to service. Our server took our drink order which was cold tea and a Coke. He came back 5 minutes later and said they 'ran out' of Coke. We asked what options he had for soft drinks and he said Mountain Dew and Sierra Mist. Great selection...not. Then what was supposed to be tea came out. It tasted like water that cleaned out a tea pot. I sent it back. Then we ordered. Since Im not big on sauces which I am unsure of I asked about what sauce the fried rice came with and was subjected to 3 minute talk from the waiter about how the restaurant  has to pay for other people's orders when they send that back. That is my problem? Completely unprofessional.  No one came to our table the whole time we were there except for the nice hostess who asked did we want a box for our to go food. Maybe that's because our waiter was at one of the other customer tables along with other waiters having a meal. If you want good Pho you can get it but get it to go.

Women's bathroom was also dirty with two stalls not for use.
