Went here for lunch. They have a surprisingly big menu, and my food was cheap and pretty tasty. My biggest problem is that they are still smoking, and they have zero ventilation and low ceilings. It's like you're sitting in a tiny smoke-filled box. The air never moves at all. I do not understand at all how this place got a smoking exemption. Everyone I saw there was eating. We arrived right at noon. The kitchen was kind of slow for the few people there, but are bartender/server was very nice and kept us refilled. So good service, horrible atmosphere (literally). I'd come back if they ever pushed the smoking out to the patio. I feel like they must have bribed an inspector to get their smoking ban exemption. The place is huge with a lot of food orders. They shouldn't have been allowed an exemption.
