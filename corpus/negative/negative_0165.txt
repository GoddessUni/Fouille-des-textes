Stopped in here for a quick bite before a show, because my friend's shoes hurt her feet so we couldn't make it further down to Bakersfield, where I wanted to go.  We were seated right away because the place was pretty much empty on a late Sunday afternoon.  It's perfect for tourists exploring Broadway to grab a bite (I'd never heard of it), but it ain't DeSano or anything really delicious like that.  It's fine if you want to grab a food-court calibre pizza.  It tasted okay, satiating and edible, no problem.  Probably just a step above Sbarro?

Service was sparse, but not frequent enough, and the plates we were handed were dirty.  Server replaced them, but made an excuse about the dishwasher.  Um, please just look at the plates before handing them to guests, maybe?  Just a thought.

I think Yelp's two-star definition of "Meh. I've experienced better." is really fitting here.  I don't think I'd eat here again because there are better options near Broadway within walking distance; I should have just carried my friend to Bakersfield.
