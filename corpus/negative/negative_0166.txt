This place isn't the breakfast place you want. This is the one you have to go to in a hotel where everything is an up charge or unavailable. 
No grits. Why would a place outside the tourist areas in Florida not offer grits. 
Refused to poach eggs. 
$4 up charge for fruit on a waffle. I don't object to a charge, but $4 is what I would expect at a hotel not a breakfast place. 
To trade the only side item of potatoes is also $2.50 for fruit. The fruit vendor they use must wear an eyepatch and bring it in from The Spanish Main. Arrr. 
Took forever to pay the check. The manager tried to offer a discount next time. 
Service was ok, no complaints. Like many places managers/owners didn't do the homework in the area to see what residents here expect in a place to have breakfast. It is a shame. 
We were hoping for a new breakfast place in the area, but this is disappointing and won't last long. 
We will see what replaces this place.
