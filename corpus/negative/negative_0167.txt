Just waited 28 minutes in the drive thru (on a not very busy day) while staff didn't do their usual walking around to take orders, all for them to tell us they "don't know" if we can get what we ordered and a deep resentful sigh when we asked them to scan their rewards app. We got to the window AFTER PAYING and were told they're not sure we can get our food (we ordered breakfast at 10:15am after waiting for at least 10 minutes in line). The girl at the window was apologetic but...this is nuts for a chick-fil-a. Got home, the order was wrong.
