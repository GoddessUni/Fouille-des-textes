I so loved the start of the evening at the bar...the bartender was displaying some serious skill and I loved the 80's soft rock playing in contrast to the crowd. It was a cool vibe. THEN, 30 minutes into our dinner hardcore rock started playing. It was the opposite of the vibe at the start of the evening and it really didn't feel it flowed. We took the next two course to go. Cool place if YOUR'RE THE vibe but not if you need one to work for you. Staff was OK but lacked genuine enthusiasm or connection or caring or ...ok. They just lacked.
