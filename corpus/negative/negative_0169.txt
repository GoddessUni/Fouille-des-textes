The only reason I'm giving this dump two stars is because 

a. they had low-fat chili
b. the cookie girl was super nice
c. It helped me to eat well while I was in St. Louis. 

I've been a fan of Sweet Tomatoes for a long time. My mom is a vegetarian. My brother is a vegan. I'm a carnivore. Our dining options in Podunk, Florida were limited because of my mom/brother's restrictions. ST has served us well over the years. I don't visit nearly as much anymore, because the closest one to Chicago is way to freaking far for my fat ass to drive. My mom and I ate at ST after a long day of driving to find this location completely mobbed. Not only was it completely mobbed, it was completely DISGUSTING. The ugly carpet was covered in letttuce, beets, rainbow sprinkles and just about every other food stuff on the buffet. The salad bar was a giant mess. The other bars were filthy messes too. Seriously, how difficult is it to have an employee wipe down the bars with some Lysol wipes and have someone vacuum the floor now and then? I would never in a million years return to this location. It was that gross.
