What a HUGE disappointment! Do NOT waste a meal here while in the French Quarter. I was told by a couple  people to come here and have in turn told half a  dozen people to do the same.... but this place is mediocre at best. We stayed in New Orleans for 5 days and this was hands down our worst meal. 

First let's talk ambiance, you walk in off Frenchman where amazing live music plays everywhere. You go upstairs and there is NO A/C..... 3 open windows and 2 ceiling fans. It's hot and stuffy, there is NO music playing or music from the cool venue downstairs being heard instead cheesy bad pop music blares from the kitchen and that is the only music you hear. It is neither romantic or quaint, it's distracting and awful. We should have left, but unfortunately stayed.

Let's talk next about the mediocre food and wine. Again we were in town for for 5 days, each meal was fantastic whether purchaed off the street or from a 4 star restaurant but this was hands down the worst most bland and poorly executed meal from the entire trip. The food is overpriced and just meh. The wine offered is awful too. The pasta at the Italian creole restaurant was terrible, just bland and runny wateree sauce. We got 2 appetizers both were ok, the salads were gas station quality, and our entrees were expensive and hard to eat. The Lamb had no sides and was just gross. 

We are foodies and we're floored this place is popular serving such slop especially in a town where everywhere you turn the food is tasty and amazing.

The only highlight was the service, it was exceptional.... but hardly made up for the terrible and overpriced food and awful atmosphere.

Beware of this place and SKIP IT... any place is better in the French Quarter...ANY place.
