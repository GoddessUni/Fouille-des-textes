My fiance and I used to love this place! It was super close to the house in Somerset and the food was great, service was always fair at best. As of the last 6 months it went from fair to absolutely sh*t. Ask to be seated at the bar. Response 45 to hour wait. 3 people sitting at 12 spots they left it a mess on purpose to not seat. The kicker not one open table. They make snyde remarks and constantly act inconvieniced. Worst service in a restaurant in reno. Don't go here an support these people!!! Go to 2 the joint and get the best service ever and not get treated like a second rate customer.
