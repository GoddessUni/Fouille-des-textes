so for all of you that used to like to go to the entenmann's outlet bakery on schuetz road you will find it in no longer exists there the store is currently closed I drove up this morning and there's two signs on each window that says that the store is permanently closed so we've lost probably the last refuge to be able to buy decent donuts and bread and such at a good price so if you're headed that way make sure that you know that that store no longer exist I'm all the shades are pulled down effect as nobody in that business right now I suspect any any food items that are in there will eventually be donated to food pantry so it's a shame just seen this closing apparently they may not have known the employees that it was going to be closing I know they close the one in West county as well proview I like myself we have to pay full price for something that we used to enjoy a lesser price
