I was very unimpressed by what I received in terms of dining experience at Urban Cantina on a Thursday night. From the beginning, it was very clear that they were understaffed, or poorly managed to where they seem understaffed. There was no dedicated bartender, which meant that all the wait staff including the hostess were bartending occasionally. This manifested in having to wait several minutes before anyone took our name. There was some confusion when we told the hostess we would sit at the bar until a table opened, at which point they thought we were just sitting at the bar and crossed our name off. We eventually got a table after revisiting the hostess a few times to try to remedy the situation. 

Once seated, it was mentioned to us several times that they have completely changed their menu recently, so they no longer have/do many of the things that the other reviewers have mentioned were good (i.e. give free chips and salsa as an appetizer ($2 now)). For drinks, we ordered margaritas, which they didn't really have a drink menu for or anything standard of a quality restaurant. The margaritas were not very good and small for the price. For food, we ordered fish and carnitas tacos and the food came out relatively quickly -- possibly the only redeeming quality of the meal. My fish tacos were decent but absolutely nothing special , and my girlfriend didn't finish her carnitas tacos because the pork was not good. 

After reading other reviews here, I can tell this place has seriously dropped in quality and would only recommend reading the most recent reviews before eating here. Unless you are really craving Mexican food and you are stuck downtown, I would look for other options in the area. No idea why they changed their menu, but if it's because they came under new management, it's clear they should change management again because they seem to be heading in the wrong direction.
