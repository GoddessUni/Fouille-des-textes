The is definitely a place you want to share plates at, and that's what we did. Highlights of the meal: the Peking duck buns, the chocolate sorbet, and the dim sum donuts. The ducks buns were so melt-in-your-mouth good. Rich, sweet, and just a little tangy. The chocolate sorbet was dark, smooth, and not too sweet. An ice cream lover myself, this was almost as good as chocolate ice cream. The donuts were delicious fried dough balls, but be warned that an order should be split. The rest of the dishes were pretty ho-hum. The tuna tartare spring rolls were a little bland;the kimchi fried rice looked promising but feel short of expectations and we wondered if they actually used Kobe beef in the dish as none of us tasted a difference from regular beef; the sea bass was good, but I've had better versions; the Chinese broccoli needed more garlic; and the pad thai was fresh-tasting but lacked depth of flavor and needed more peanuts.

The interior is really beautiful, especially if you ignore the odd faces on the seat backs. Our waitress was nice and definitely helpful with the menu, but I am not pressed to go back here. The food was overall mediocre, and the prices are just too high to make venturing back for the standout dishes worthwhile.
