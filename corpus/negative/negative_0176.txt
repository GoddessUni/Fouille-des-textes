I don't even know where to start. We were referred by the Hop On Hop off bus tour guide who stated it was a great place to eat. Upon arriving the Hostess was sweet and welcoming. We got seated on the balcony since she knew we were out of town and wanted to give us the ambiance of NOLA. Our waiter on the other hand was not friendly (Jacob T). I think he needed to go home and restart his day. He was slow and we felt as though he did not want to be there. We ordered an appetizer and drinks...old fashion and a fruity blend. Both were horrible needless to say. We ordered our food of which came out cold and at the same time as our appetizer. Our waiter was not attentive at all and no courtesy of offering water. We had to send our side  back since it was cold. We ordered the glazed chicken which was good and fell apart from the bones. We were ready to leave as soon as we could and do not recommend to visitors. Totally disappointed.
