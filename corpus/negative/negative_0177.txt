THIS REVIEW DISCUSSES VEGETARIAN OPTIONS.

So they came to my job for our Food Truck Friday and oh boy.

They took around 30 minutes to just set up; we have a designated lunch time and rather than showing up early, they came RIGHT at the beginning of it. Their customer service was lacking too - they didn't warn anyone about time delays and such, and overall they seemed very unenthused.

The food was also mediocre for the price. I ordered a seitan cheesesteak and there was no cheese...? I was the third person in line and after waiting at this point for around 50 minutes (30 for setup and 20 for waiting for the actual food), I was disappointed. (Who doesn't offer ketchup with a cheesesteak btw?) The mac and cheese was also cold and pretty neutral. So, $18 down the drain. Ugh. I will not eat here again and no one else I spoke to that day was really impressed either.
