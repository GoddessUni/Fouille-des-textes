I've been to this restaurant twice previously and went today for brunch and am not sure what exactly has happened to this place. We got there about 40 mins after open and there were no other guests in our dining room so I can't even use them being busy for an excuse. For starters we got the FGT which we've had before and was so delicious, but instead of the normal plating it was one full tomato and then broken up bits of two others on a plate of lettuce and little piles of pimento cheese scattered around the plate. The very few pieces of pork belly we got were severely burnt. It genuinely looked like the scraps from last nights dinner service. For entrees we got the shrimp and grits and the smoked salmon Benedict. The shrimp and grits were so bland there wouldn't be enough salt in the world to enhance the flavor. The smoked salmon Benny which normally is covered in delicious hollandaise had a drop on each over poached egg and was extremely salty. The server was nice enough, but after bragging her menu knowledge the second she saw the plating of our appetizer, and the fact that we barely touched our food she should have at least acknowledged the fact that something clearly was going on in the kitchen. Hopefully it's just a one off but for how expensive this place is I except a lot more.
