Really disappointed with my past few visits to Datz. Went for brunch last weekend and we ordered the Breakfast BLT and the Belly Breakfast Burrito. The potatoes that came with my breakfast BLT were bland and the burrito always seems to be missing the pork belly that is listed on the menu. The bread on my BLT was also dry, and I wish they would just update their Egg Sammies options. 

I remember the food having way more flavor once upon a time, but it's been a while since I've truly enjoyed my experience at Datz. Won't be going back for a long time.
