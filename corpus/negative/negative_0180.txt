The most TERRIBLE customer service I have ever witnessed! I ordered my meal at 5:30 online, to be picked up at 6:30. I get there on time, pay for my food, get my drink which  I had ordered a large, but got a medium. Ok no big deal it was an extra .40 cents. I get home and my food is FREEZING cold. I had also ordered a mix and match (which I thought the computer did for you, apparently not) so I called to tell them my food is cold and my order is incomplete.... The manager HUNG up on me. I called back to get an higher up number, as I know it's late in the day and they aren't there. They couldn't give it to me, stating that "they don't have it" okkkkkk? Needless to say, I will NEVER spend my money at this location again! They are terrible with their following directions, which my 2 year old could do, and HORRENDOUS customer service!!!
