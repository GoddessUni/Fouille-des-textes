They always close sooner than the actual closing time. The drive thru is supposed to be open until 12 am but they've been closing at least an hour before. One of the last times I went around 11 they were actually open, the guy took my order but as soon as I got up to the window to pay he then told me they were out of everything but onion rings. He gave them to me for free for the inconvenience which was very nice, but it seemed like the employees were just being lazy and didn't wanna do their job. I don't get off work until 11 and love Burger King, so I'd actually like for them to stay open until the posted time and not be lazy about serving their customers food.
