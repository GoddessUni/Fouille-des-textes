After reading all the reviews, I have been looking forward to going to Buffa's for a while. 

I was quite disappointed. We went for brunch after the crescent city classic. My partner asked for the eggs Benedict, but only wanted one of the two eggs. And she asked if it were possible if she could have a side of the corn maque chouz on the side (it was served with one of the other entrees).

The answer? No, we can't make any exceptions to what is on the menu because we are expecting a big rush after the race. Maybe, that rush came. There were maybe a dozen customers in the place at the time.

So, they brought her two eggs, one of which she ate.

I ordered the BLT, which was fine. It came with home fries, which were also ok.

For the record, we offered to pay full price for the eggs Benedict, just wanted one egg instead of two.
