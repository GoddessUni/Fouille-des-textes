Poor service.  Beyond mediocre food.  I ordered scallops with no dairy.  They came served with melted feta cheese.  The redo was like rubber, inedible, I sent it back.  The baked potato came served to me without a plate, in a wrapper directly on the table.  Seriously, WTF?!?!  If I had known it would be this terrible, I would have skipped a late dinner altogether and gone straight to sleep.  The third round was edible, but super mediocre.  When I asked for the check, the server dropped it on my table with no acknowledgement of any kind and walked away... just as she did with the baked potato.  She said she was new... but seriously, WTF?!?!

No redeeming qualities here.  Not coming back!!!  No food would be better than this place.
