I had few bad experiences with this Starbucks.

First, the quality (or taste) of the drinks is not consistent, sometime, it is strong, too strong, (I had a green tea latte that taste BITTER), sometimes it is tasteless, (had a mocha that taste like water)...

Second is the service. The last time I came here, after I placed my order, I thought maybe I should reload my Starbucks card too. So I hand my money and card to the staff, she said "Next time you reload before you order". How in the world do I know which way is more convenient for you?!!! Not even a PLEASE? really?!!!

Now I rather walk few blocks away to the Barnes and NOble Starbucks on Broad St to get my drinks. Atleast their service and drinks are comparable to other Starbucks. I think since we are paying for our drinks, we deserve to get a good quality drinks, not just drinks with a brand without quality!!! Starbucks company should really look into this...
