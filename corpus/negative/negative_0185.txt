My co workers and I used to eat at Katz's regularly. Until today.

Katz's offers a buy 10 sandwiches, get 1 free. Well, after purchashing my 10 sandwiches I went in today to redeem my free sandwhich.  Well, the owner came out and said that the intitials that were written on the card, were not legitimate and that no one in the restaurant has those intitials.  Is that some kind of joke? 
The owner accused me of lieing. She accused who was once a loyal customer, a liar. 
I am furious and I can promise I will never return to that shit hole again and will be sure that no one I know will return either.
