My husband and I celebrated our 25th anniversary here last Sunday, so I will try to be very specific for why I gave them the rating I did. 

Minus one star- We walked in through the inside mall entrance and nobody was there to greet us. There was only a sign at the front hostess stand indicating to go to the hostess stand at the back of restaurant.  So we had to walk through all the diners not knowing where we were going, which was very awkward. Even Outback Steakhouse, where you pay far less $$, makes people feel more welcome by always having a greeter at the front stand. 

Minus one star - Both our steaks were overcooked and came out well done (we asked for them to be medium). If your claim to fame is steak, you had best get that right. 

Minus one star - Lighting was WAY too dim to the point where diners at three separate tables had to use their iPhone flashlights to read the menu.  Caesar salad dressing was WAY too fishy from the amount of anchovies in it and the small slices of bread that came with the salad were way too tough and dry; we received no bread and butter even though we asked our waitress twice for it. 

On the plus side, the Palm Passion martini was amazing!

Maybe they were just off their game that night or other people have lowered the bar for expectations of 5 star service. 

I would save your hard-earned cash and spend it at another upscale steakhouse like Sullivans, where we have had two previous stellar experiences.
