WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!
They claim to be open until 11pm, so at 9:50 we entered and there was still people eating there, so we decided to order and eat there. At 10:10pm the guys over there just decided it was time to go home and started cleaning up the place without saying a word to us (of course we were still waiting for our food). I understand that if you are going to close at 11pm you need to start cleaning in advance but you DO NOT BLEACH the floor next to clients that are waiting to eat there and 50 minutes before you close!. It's like saying go away now!. The smell was so strong and irritating that of course nobody could eat there. 
We asked what was going on and why they were bleaching if we said we would eat there and it just got worse. The guy in the front desk said: "so what's the big deal, take your food and eat home"....excuse me???....what did you just said?, not only he didn't apologize but ignored us saying he had a call to make and simply started talking with his girlfriend over the phone. That was too much!
We asked for the manager and not one of the 4 people working there "knew" the manager name...yes of course, It was unbelievable.
In this place they don't care at all about their customers, they were extremely rude, they ignored us and on top of that lied to us!
THE WORST I've experienced in my life.
