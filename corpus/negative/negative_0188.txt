This is one of my go-to places but today  was a disappointment.  Stopped in for quick bite and glass of wine just after end of lunch rush.  Lunch staff looked like they were doing their cut work and I understand the remaining wait staff picks up extra tables.
However, should not take this long to get two glasses of wine.
Bartender was chatting with her counter customers, so she wasn't slammed.
We watched our server talk to a co-worker, then go make him a drink behind the bar, then bring it to him along with a water to another customer, go back and talked to employee who must have been off work.  FINALLY she went behind bar and poured our wine.
It may be picky...but IMO customers should be taken care of before employees.

I will be back, I just hope she learns better.  Instead of lunch, we had our wine and left.
