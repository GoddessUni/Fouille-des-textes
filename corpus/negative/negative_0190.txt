Last week I would have given this place 4 or 5 stars but upon returning for a second visit I am not happy. 

First time here, I dined in. The food was pretty good and the service was as well, but it was also fairly empty as it was around 9pm. Despite the LACK OF AMBIANCE, and fact that MOST ROLLS ONLY HAVE 5 OR 6 PIECES, I left very eager to return. 

Second time, last night around 6pm, I wanted some take out and I thought I'd give this place another try over my regular place, Sushi Teri. BAD IDEA. It was absolutely packed, and there was really no area for me to stand and look at the menu to order takeout, I kept getting shuffled from one side of the room to the other. Then when the lady charged my card she "forgot" to tell me they add a 5% takeout charge...I spent about 10 minutes trying to figure out where the extra $2.00 came from, they also added it BEFORE tax. Annoying considering I went here thinking it would be cheaper than my usual place, only to have it end up more.

Now, my main issue...I found it a little odd that the majority of their roll selection was either with tempura inside and/or drenched in spicy/sweet sauce. I wanted some fresh fish and didn't feel like paying $13 for a rainbow roll. The one roll I got that was with tempura tasted fine. But, the second roll with fresh fish tasted kind of funny, like it wasn't fresh. I get the feeling they might hide behind the tempura and all the sauces to hide the fact that the fish isn't so fresh. 

I could have ignored that, and assumed it was just in my head, UNTIL being woken up this morning with the worst "stomach issues" I have had in a long time. It's possible it's just a coincidence but I kind of doubt it.  Might return for dine-in, in the future if other people wanted to go, but I will stick to ordering my take-out from Sushi Teri. Much better quality and my bill would have been lower and given me 8 pieces per roll instead of 5.
