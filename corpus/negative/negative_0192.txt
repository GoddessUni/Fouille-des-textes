I really wanted to like this place but I just wasn't satisfied. I visited today for lunch and upon walking in, it felt like the heat was on! I ordered the crab cake sandwich with fresh fruit as a side with a bottle of apple juice. 14 bucks but it wasn't worth it - my fruit cup was mushy (definitely not fresh) and while the sandwich looked appetizing, it was somewhat mealy and just seemed like a lot of filler. 
Maybe if the AC was working, I could've had a slightly better experience but it was so uncomfortable I didn't even stick around to exchange my overripe fruit in hopes of a better tasting selection. Most of my meal went to the trash.
I didn't buy one but they did have a tasty looking variety of snack sized cakes. Maybe I'll go back for one and hopefully update this review positively.
