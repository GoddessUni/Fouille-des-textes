I wanted to like this place.  The ambience is a rustic camping feel- maybe a little on the cheesy side. We arrived shortly after they opened for dinner. Started with the fried green tomatoes that were just ok. If I had to guess, they started in the freezer. My entree was the BBQ Feast which was a half rack of ribs (claimed to be the best in Nashville by their sign), BBQ chicken breast (also claimed to be the best I've tasted), and your choice of two sides.  I chose the campfire potatoes and steamed vegetables. If these were the best ribs Nashville had to offer then the whole city needs to stop serving them.  The ribs fell off the bone easily enough, but they were terribly dry with a non-descript sauce. I'm certain that those ribs were leftover from last night and reheated from the hardened crust on the outside. The chicken breast was equally as dry and had the same blah sauce. The campfire potatoes were very well-done chunks of potatoes (more than likely started frozen as well) with a pile of saut√©ed onions on top.  It was served in a small dish that made it impossible to cut the onion slices into bite-sized pieces. The steamed veggies were ok, but they came out so hot that I had to wait to eat them until nearly the end of my meal. The portions were huge, but even with that, this was very overpriced for the quality. 

There was something they did really well.  The corn fritters were delicious. Sadly, they aren't enough to ever bring me back to eat here again on during my twice yearly visits to Nashville.
