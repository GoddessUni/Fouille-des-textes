NEVER WILL COME HERE AGAIN! My family and I just stopped here tonight to pick up food because they still have the drive thru open during the COVID-19 crisis. Upon pulling up to the window we noticed that several employees were not properly wearing masks nor were they wearing gloves. When they opened the window we asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over, not properly wearing his mask, and told us the reason for that was because the kitchen is extremely hot. While that is unfortunate, we are in the middle of a pandemic and workers should be taking the extra precautions to be safe themselves and to also keep our food sanitary. Once the manager walked away and the window closed, the young woman working the window started talking badly about us while we can hear her through the window. She then gave us sass when we confronted her about it. Extremely rude and extremely inappropriate. We will be calling the Health Department first thing tomorrow morning.
