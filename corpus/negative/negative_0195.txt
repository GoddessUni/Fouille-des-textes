I had purchased a Groupon certificate (I got a deal for $10 for $30).  My friend and me went there in late February,2013 for lunch.  We were the only ones there and it was about 12:30 PM but to be fair the day was cold and still snow on the ground.  The place was very dark and dreary.  Hard to see anything.  Looked more like a dark bar rather than a place to serve food.  If I didn't have the Groupon;we would have left based on the menu and the appearance.  Bu we stayed.  Ordered a deluxe pizza  st louis style for $23 and two $7.00 a piece salads and one water and a very weak,tasteless glass of tea.  Pizza was horrible in all aspects. Way,way,way over priced for the quality.  Sparse toppings,tasteless sauce, and more like a frozen pizza.  I would say it was honestly worth maybe $10 at the most.  Salads were horrible.....wilted lettuce an a few crumbs of cheese.  Worth about $2 or $3 at the most a piece.  We were in shock most of the lunch.  It was almost like food was an afterthought and certainly wasn't focused on here.  Overall, it appeared like this place had and was on the decline for several years and was "cheap" on everything from food to drink.  To top it off; we were given little packets of Parmesan and red peppers for the pizza.  This place needs "Restaurant Impossible" to save it and, in fact, I would highly recommend it.  Horrible food,horrible ambiance,cheap,cheap quality but not the price.
