The wait staff was extremely rude and never even gave us menus when we sat down. We eventually walked up to a waitress and asked her for one after nobody had even acknowledged us for 30 minutes. After finally receiving menus and we were ready to order, the bartender or waitress or whatever was hanging out at the bar and flirting with a table of men for a good 45 minutes. It's not like the bar was busy. We were one of two tables ordering food. So after receiving poor customer service and enough eyerolls to last a lifetime, we eventually left after waiting another half hour for the waitress to bring our cards back. Would not recommend.
