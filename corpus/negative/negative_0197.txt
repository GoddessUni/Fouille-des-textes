I really love the falafel and the cozy atmosphere.  I took my mom who is not very familiar with ethnic food and she stated to the waitress flat out that she has never been and was looking for some suggestions.  She was met with a blank stare and a fair amount of impatience.  I have been to pick up food and have always had a similar experience with this woman.  Just not the nicest egg in the bunch. But whatev.  I like the food for the most part.  I don't like the cucumber/tomato salad as the cucumbers are pickled and it's kinda like WHOA in your mouth or the grape leaves just because I'm so used to Greek grape leaves.  My last quirp is that the bathroom had a yuck feel to it and they no longer accept credit cards.  Who has cash on them these days?  Not this girl!

Update: came back today and was met with the same rude blonde waitress as always. My mom tried paying with a 100 dollar bill and she flat out said " I can't break that." My mom said "oh oh, I can give you a debit card" to which she replied "no cards accepted". Uhhh.

So she finally says "i mean fine if you want singles back".  Ok... Less than a minute later she throws back the 100 on the table and says "yeah I can't break it" and walks away.  We had to scrounge for change to pay. I don't understand...if you don't accept cards, then shouldn't you make sure you have at least 56 dollars in change to give ?! Can't stand this woman.
