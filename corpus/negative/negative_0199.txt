I walked inside and received a warm inviting energy from the hostess and another employee. I was sat and waited for at least 10 minutes as I watched a server address another table next to me asking if they needed anything else. Mind you, the Resturarant was not uber busy. Then, another server went to the same table to make sure their water glasses were full. This server made direct eye contact with me and walked away. After this obvious mess, I collected my things, walked over to the hostess and said," if you did not want to serve me than you should not have sat me. They too looked at me in disbelief and asked if I was served water. I replied NO and shared that I would be tweeting and Yelping this amazing experience. The End.
