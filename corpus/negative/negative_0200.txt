This place was becoming a solid go-to restaurant but one waiter and his manager changed that.

Other patrons in the restaurant gave us a menu because the waiter didn't. He was very confused and seemed flustered in a restaurant that was not full. He brought out the wrong dish for me and when I asked to have the kitchen make what I ordered, he argued and then said he would. Then his manager came out and proceeded to try and convince me that the wrong dish was "almost the same thing." I felt very disrespected; why not let me have what I ordered? I tried to eat the dish they insisted I keep, but it wasn't good, and that's why I didn't order it to begin with. We had to pay for it too which made me really salty tbh. 

It's a shame because I've had really good experiences before this one, but this was enough to keep me from going back.
