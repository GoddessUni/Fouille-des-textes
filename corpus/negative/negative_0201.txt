Visiting from a land locked state where it's hard to find fresh sea food, I was told to try Scully's. I was pretty disappointed. The fish and chips were not that great especially considering it cost about $15-too breaded. Also the fries that came with it were obviously the previously frozen kind you get in a bag at Costco/SAMs club. My boy friend ordered the crab (a $28 plate) and the crab was over cooked so the meat came out shredded in tiny pieces rather than in a whole chunk.  The upside to this place was after we kindly asked the wait staff what could be done, the manager and waiter were very quick to acknowledge the problem-noting the crab was over cooked, and immediately and without hesitation removed a portion of the check.
