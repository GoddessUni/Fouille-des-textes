The Rack is an odd concoction of billiards, bar, and sushi restaurant. The first time I went I actually had no idea they served sushi. It doesn't look remotely Asian persuasion. I'd say the main attraction is the drinking, since they do have great drink specials. This place is loud!! Between the games and jukebox blaring pop and country sounds, it's not exactly the place to get your zen on with raw goodies. The sushi menu is way more appetizing to read than to feast upon. My rolls were way too small for the prices, and a bit too "fishy" flavored. This clashing combo just didn't work for me.
