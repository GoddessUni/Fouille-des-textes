I am never eating at this establishment again. I placed my order of Ham and Cheese on a roll. The sandwich maker wiped the dirty counter with a rag that looked like it hadn't been washed in days and then proceed to make my sandwich without changing her gloves. I thought to myself, "that's pretty gross," but against my better judgement I decided to eat it. Once I got back to my office and tasted the ham, I immediately tasted something weird. Again, against my better judgement, I continued eating it. Fast forward about 5 hours and I regret that I even noticed this place. This was on a Wednesday. I was vomiting and had a bad case of diarrhea which continued throughout the weekend. I had to take off of work on Thursday and did not feel 100% until the next Tuesday. Needless to say, worst hoagie of my life.

Yelp needs to put in a no stars option so I can give it to this place!
