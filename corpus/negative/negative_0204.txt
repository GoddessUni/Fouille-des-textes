Ummm - the main plus to this store is it's location. And as well all know, Philadelphia is "location,location,location"
I just haven't had good experiences here. I find it to be a bit overpriced and the pharmacy I have given up on. EVERY time I think picking up a RX there will be easy and painless it never has been. So I gave up years ago. This week I went in there to kill a little time before my dog walking job and to my delight I had a mouse run right past my foot in the middle part of the store where all the aisles converge. I did tell someone at the photo dept but she didn't seem too freaked out. Maybe Bc of the warehouse area and the food deliveries they're used to it. Who knows?......I like the quick photo convenience but I can't stand the constant harassment from the panhandlers RIGHT outside the front door. It's an annoyance and sometimes if I'm on the other side of Broad st, I'll just go to the Rite Aid.........
