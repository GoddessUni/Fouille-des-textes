I went to Harvest Cafe & Catering Downtown for breakfast with a friend on Sunday August 25th. I did not have a positive experience, and would not recommend this place to others. We got seeded quickly, but the guitarist playing was loud. I ordered extra bacon with my breakfast that did not come with my breakfast. The meal took a long time to make, and the owner told us that we should just expect it to take 25 minutes. That might not have been so bad if the server at least checked in with us. It would have taken less than 30 seconds to let us know our food was being delayed. Then, my friend didn't get his orange juice until our breakfast came. It thought the price was a little steep as well.
