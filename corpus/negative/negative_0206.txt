Not  good. Izzo's is located in the river walk mall. We went in for lunch. When first ordering my chicken bowl I said hello to the girl she just said what do you want. I proceeded to get the chicken bowl there are two different kinds of chicken I asked the difference she just repeated what kinds I ended up with the darkened chicken with beans both refried and black. I had corn, pico, lettuce, black olives and Cilantro for about $9. Was going to have guacamole for a 1 ounce scoop it was $2 a bit pricey I checked out and asked for a tortilla shell it was $1.50 more I was thinking maybe.50 cents again pricey.  The food looked good it was terribly salty each bite was worse then the one before I drank a bottle of water and ate the crust off my husbands pizza.
