I've never received such poor service in my life. I've worked in the industry and was absolutely appalled by the way the "bartender" spoke to my boyfriend and I. After sitting at the bar for 5 mins waiting for someone to notice our presence, the young female bartender arrived from another room and began stocking the bar. No big, someone needs to do it. After she completed that task, she started chatting with a friend at the end of the bar. We're going on 10 mins. here now people. I got up and asked her if we could please have 2 beers, to which she responded "WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN WAITING LONG OR SOMETHING??!?! DID I SEE YOU????" See, that's not really my issue to figure out. I shouldn't have been waiting at all. The way the interaction works is you ask what I want, I tell you, then I pay you for it; a simple exchange. Instead, it turned into me getting scolded and this awesome conveyor of customer service returning to talk to her friend, within ear shot, about me, my boyfriend and our simple request that she fulfill her duties as the tender of bar. This interaction turned a neighborhood bar that we once loved into a place we never returned again. 

2 stars for the other staff, the historical aspect and the roast beef sandwiches, just do yourself a favor and don't even step over the threshold when the younger bartender is working.
