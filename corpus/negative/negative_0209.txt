As much as I'm tempted to make more Asian accent jokes, I want to be serious for a second. I would have loved to have tried their food, but they didn't even acknowledge my presence there, I had no clue where to go to start, There were two other people there that were either waiting to order or pick up food and they looked like they were getting ready to close even though it was like 2:30pm. The people waiting seemed to also be getting very impatient. I must have been in there for a good 18-20 minutes waiting to even order. Pretty bad customer service in my opinion. I will not go there ever or recommend people go there. I would not be surprised if they get shut down or lose business entirely.
