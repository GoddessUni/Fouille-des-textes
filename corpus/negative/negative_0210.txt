Horrible customer service and the women there discriminate against men in favor of women......very rude and when you complain to management they laugh,,,,because they do not care....The deli is a night a night mare unsupervised,. they cook chickens and lay them out and leave them just laying out for flys' etc to land on,. they can;t be bothered to cover them and out them under the lights. So I only went a dozen times since I moved here. The way it looks is the broke down store and its broke down people are supported by the poverty elderly stricken apt. next door they feed on each other and therefore are justified in their mind to treat an outsider like garbage...and just like that. So anyone may do as they like in our free country and do't believe me........its your money
