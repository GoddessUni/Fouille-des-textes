I really wanted to try this place.  We set out to order our food ahead and they were too busy.  Yup.  Too busy!  I was blown away.  I said sarcastically ok we will go so someplace else and he said, "yes, that's a good idea".  As s business owner, I was absolutely horrified.  I will call back and speak to a manager to let them know my experience.  Dumbfounded.  The food looks great.  The commercials on tv look great.  This just goes to show you that if you don't have the right people in place, it doesn't matter.  

We instead went to Bascetti's where the welcomed us in!  What a concept.
