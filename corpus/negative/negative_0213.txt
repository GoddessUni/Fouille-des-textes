Definitely went here on a Saturday night.  But not sure if it's really a restaurant or not.  Paid a $10 cover to get in, drinks were fairly reasonable--was already drinking across the street at the GC before I came in so I can't remember what the prices were but for a beer and mixed drink ran about $11?.  For a Saturday night, it wasn't very busy at all.

The dancers were friendly but more your girl (single young mom) next door type and a lot less the model type.  There were one or two notable entertainers, but they tended to be popular and never got around to me and my friend.  They had a private lapdance area but I wasn't inclined to try it.

If the 40-something with bad breath didn't try so hard to talk to me, I may have stayed longer...but she wouldn't go away!!  We were on the way to AC anyhow.

This place is the kind of place where if you wanted to chill with some lo-pro-ho's and not blow a huge wad (of cash) across the street.  Definitely a contrast!

Would I come here again?  Sure, if I was in the area and feeling a lil' dirty!
