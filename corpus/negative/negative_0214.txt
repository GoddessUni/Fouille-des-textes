This would be negative stars if it was allowed.  I ordered food through DoorDash and 2 hours later the food was still "being prepared" (Buffalo Wild Wings wouldn't cancel the order to let us get a refund).  Three DoorDash drivers gave up on the order.  We never did get our order and DoorDash was kind enough to cancel it on their end for a refund.  While I was dealing with DoorDash, I called BWW to find out why it was taking so long and was on hold for 45 minutes without getting to a live person (I wanted to see if they would ever answer their phones...apparently they don't do that sort of thing).  I have always enjoyed the food at Buffalo Wild Wings, but this is the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE I have ever experienced in my 50 years.  I will NEVER go to the Wesley Chapel restaurant and please do yourself a favor and avoid this restaurant like the plague!  They deserve to go out of business.
