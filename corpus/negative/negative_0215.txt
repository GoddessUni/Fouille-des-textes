Horrible customer service. They could use a huge attitude adjustment. Would love a call from corporate.I'm hoping corporate pays attention to these reviews. 
The attitude of the employees is horrendous. Last week they messed up my order. I called the store and when I told them they forgot to put my sandwich in the bag they told me to hold on. They layed the phone down and left it sit there for 12 min I finally hung up and called corporate. Later that evening I got a call from the store manager apologizing for the bad service and promised a meal to make up for it. I stopped by today and they had no record of it but told me to pull around anyway. I said I needed to order a sandwich as well she said spicy or classic. I said both classic. I pull around they hand me one sandwich.  I asked where the other was and she knew nothing about it. She was very unhappy about something not sure if it was me or life in general. She did not 
say thank you, sorry I'll be just a minute getting the rest of your order, she just walked away.  She came back with the sandwich and handed it to me. I said thank you and she stuck her nose up and ignored me on purpose. 
We won't be going back unless they clean up their act. There are too many other places to go.
