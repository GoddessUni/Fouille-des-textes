I'm really trying to like this place, but it just isn't happening.

I sit at the bar at restaurants for lunch because I usually eat alone and typically there is better service. 

Then this happened. 

I sat  down and it took 10 minutes for someone to notice me and take my drink order. Then it took them 10 more minutes to come back and get my food order. After I ordered my enchiladas, a Spanish speaker sat down next to me, was greeted almost immediately, and had a drink. 10 minutes later they delivered his food. It had been 45 minutes since I had been in the restaurant and all I was served was one drink and a bowl of salsa.

Several seats down there were a group of 4 men who were there as long as I was without their food. Their food was delivered as they were getting up to walk out which they then were comped and placed into to go bags.

I walked out shortly after with no lunch because I couldn't wait either.

Their kitchen is a mess and their service staff need more training. Don't go here unless you are prepared to wait. However, I plan on going back one more time in case this was a fluke day, but I don't have high hopes per the previous reviews.
