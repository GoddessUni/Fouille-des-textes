No stars if that were an option horrible horrible food!

My fiancé and I ordered from this place through the SB menus App we usually have great experience trying new restaurants the mobile app has to offer but SB menus needs to take this place off of the app i really wish we had have read the reviews before ordering. The food was a nightmare, very poorly put together ...repulsive! They delivered us rancid food! You know the restaurant is awful when they mess up an order as simple as a club sandwich,the bacon on my fiancées club was dark brown & grey in color and obviously old not fresh. I ordered Chinese (orange chicken w/fried rice rice) which was a disgrace to real Chinese food, the rice was hard smelled and tasted funny. Their "orange chicken" was a mushy mess didn't look, taste or smell like orange chicken, tasted rancid just like the turkey on my financees sloppily put together club sandwich. The health department seriously needs to inspect this place, worst food I've ever had in Santa Barbara! I don't see how this place is even still in business serving people out dated food.
