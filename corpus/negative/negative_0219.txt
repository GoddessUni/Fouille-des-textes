DISAPPOINTMENT.

4 Stars for the vibe

On a recent Friday night, nearly every other restaurant in the area was booked up. Bayona was the only restaurant that had plenty of reservations to choose from. I think that about sums it up.

The menu was two pages long, but somehow felt really small. Most of our party just ordered appetizers as none of the entrees seemed appealing. 

Nothing we ordered was bad, but not one dish was actually good either. It was all mediocre. A few of the dishes were comically small. I would stay away from the rabbit and the pork and especially the goat cheese crouton appetizer. There is a chance the kitchen ran our of goat cheese and just used ricotta instead.

The service was sweet but almost comically bad. Our table got two servers, which is probably a good thing, because neither of them really knew what they were doing.

The dinner starts with one of the servers reading every item on the menu to you - which is completely pointless since they just read what is on the menu.

One of the items I was interested in was a green gazpacho, which the menu said was garnished with fresh cheese. I asked the server what was inside the soup. 

"The soup is made with fresh cheese," the server said.

I asked what else was in the soup. "The fresh cheese seems more like a garnish, what else is in the actual soup," I asked.

"Potatoes," was the reply. Followed by a long blank stare.

"Tomatoes?" 

"No. Potatoes. The gazpacho is a cream of potato." More staring.

The wine knowledge, and the explanations for every single other dish on the menu were equally detailed. 

I really wanted Bayona to be good. It's set in an old charming house in the quarter, but I would stay away as there so many other restaurants in the area that I liked more.
