The newly renovated Denny's is a huge step up from the dirty, dilapidated thing that it has been for the last few years. But it seems like the staff is totally brand new and needs some help. Our server was very quiet, no big deal, but she was rarely at our table but seemed to be fine with the other tables in her section. Not once did we get refills, silverware, or asked if we needed anything. We finally got silverware from another table. Our food was delivered to the wrong table and she never told us or updated us, just had us wait 45 minutes. She had it remade and came over with it and chuckled about how it was given to the wrong people. But it wasn't really funny to us. If she had been attentive or at least given us refills it wouldn't have been a big deal. We were in no hurry and enjoying conversation but the service was bad, bad, bad all around. There was no saving grace and a renovation surely doesn't make up for the terrible service. We paid and the hostess asked it how it was and I told her and she said "okay". Why ask if you don't care and don't want to hear what we were going to say?
