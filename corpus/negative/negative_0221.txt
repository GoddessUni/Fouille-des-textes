I've really tried to like this place. The lighting, design and ambiance is pretty good. But, on the 5 different occasions that I have been invited out by friends (all different, all groups vowing to go elsewhere next time), the prices were high and the food was cheap-tasting. The only redeeming menu item I've had is their strawberry sangria. The last time I went, just this past Saturday, I paid $10 to valet and when I turned in my ticket at the end of the night, the guy asked me to wait at the street where they'd bring my car around for me. After 15 minutes, he came back up to me, asked what kind of car I had, and then pointed down the street where he had ended up parking it and handed me my keys so I can walk down there myself. Unacceptable.
