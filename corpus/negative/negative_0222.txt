I would definitely skip this place.  The people who operated it were clearly not the owners because they didn't have any cares about the customers.  I got in at 8pm on 3/7/17 and they close at 9pm so I thought I had plenty of time to enjoy the food but the person at the counter asked me to move to another area during my dinner so that she could sweep the floor and begin closing the store.  I ordered a salad and a pizza.  They forgot to serve me my salad and the pizza was quite bad.  It was under cooked, had a soggy crust and was extremely greasy.  The place has potential but the people took no pride in their work or their customer service.
