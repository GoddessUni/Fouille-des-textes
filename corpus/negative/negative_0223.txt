This place was absolutely awful. The food was not good, no flavor and mushy. We spent $100 plus and every dish we ordered came out cold. Had to be returned to the kitchen only to be heated in a microwave and returned to our table. It took over 90 minutes for our food to even be delivered in the first place and we had three children. When the food came out called and requested a manager come to our table, which nobody came. So then I had to go and find him in the bar. Having lived in LA and New York City and Chicago and having traveled the world, I do have hogh expectations, but this place was very very bad. And the way that the owner handled my situation was just purely insulting. He offered to take $25 off of my tab for the inconvenience. $25 off of the food that we left sitting on the table.
