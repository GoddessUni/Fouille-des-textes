I stopped by on 2/14/2012 while on a business trip during happy hour.  I don't drink, so I can't comment on the ales or beers.  I ordered the buffalo wings for an appetizer and a bacon cheeseburger with a side of chicken tortilla soup for my entree.  

The 8 wings were spicy, well fried, large, and overall pretty good.  The bleu cheese was terrible - never have I had bleu cheese so watery.  They were also served with carrots, celery, and kale.  The burger came with all the toppings on the side.  It had 1 piece of cheddar cheese, and they forgot to put the bacon on.  After asking about it, they brought me a plate of crispy bacon.  Overall, the burger was 'meh'.  It lacked flavor and wasn't special.  I asked for it medium-rare, but got medium-well instead.  The soup was spicier than most chicken tortilla soups and was just ok. 

Service was adequate, the wait was good, but the food wasn't that great.  I was disasspointed when I got my bill and didn't get any happy hour deals on food.  To be fair, the signs around the place said happy hour was from 4-7, but no where on the menu did it say anything about it.

There are a lot of better places on State Street worth going to.
