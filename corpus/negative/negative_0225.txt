This was a very disappointing experience with this company.  On the day of the event, the delivery was incorrect (they had the invitation in the file), the food was not assembled, rolls were dry, meat portions did not fit the rolls (we threw it all away).  Worse, there was no one to get in touch with on a Saturday afternoon--all answering machines.
The following Monday the staff member called for the credit card.  I told her of my displeasure--she was defensive, rude, and blaming.  When I finally reminded her that I was the customer and wanted an apology, she said "well if that is what it will take to get your credit card number, then I am sorry."
I finally found a manager to email who was also initially defensive, finally understood the mistakes and did apologize via email.  She offered me a brie appetizer to make up for the catastrophe, really?  I paid the charge in full and have not heard anymore from this poorly managed organization.  Buyer beware.  You can build a reputation for years and lose it in five minutes.  I had my five minutes with that surly staff member.
