EXTREMELY POOR SERVICE!! A party of 15+ of us went in for a NYE lunch and ordered a few dishes first, planning on ordering more after. Portions were TINY, filled with tofu and barely any rice/noodles, with one plate not even sufficient for one person. Thai ice teas were majority ice and barely any tea - and when this was pointed out, were met with rude attitude. I guess angry from being pointed out, the lady brought out our check without even ASKING if we were done and started picking up our plates and utensils. We were planning on ordering another dish + desert so their loss.... Have dealt with bad attitude but NEVER enough to make me want to post about it.
