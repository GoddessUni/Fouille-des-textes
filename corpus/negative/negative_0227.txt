The owners were quite rude and not very accommodating .my family and some friends (10 in all ) meet there and I was asked by my sister who had been there several times to bring a cheese plate as she and others have done many times before  ..I made sure to ask that this was ok to do and even checked their website to make sure ..there was no menu no mention that no outside food was not allowed  ..they stopped me on the way in and said they don't allow outside food we serve food Now and offered to put in the fridge ..I didn't  make a fuss ..my sister was Insulted when they said if your here to get drunk your in the wrong place ...my sister had never been to the winery before ..we shrugged it off , did a tasting , bought acouple bottles of wine ,and ordered some pizza service was slow but they took time to watch we didn't bring any outside food .when the food came they basically threw it on the table ..and never came back with napkins plates ...the pizza was ok and the wine ..so back to the car to get Napkins and plates being watched again ..we ate,cleaned up ,brought back our glasses  and went to unionville winery 10 mins down the road and was treated very well  ...not one of us will ever go back and I suggest you find someplace else
