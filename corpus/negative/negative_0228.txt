I ordered food last week and walked in to a large bald heavyset employee screaming at a an older customer standing there silently with a shocked look on his face. I wasn't there from the beginning so I don't know what happened to lead up to this, but from what I could gather it had something to do with the customer asking for fewer pickles on his sandwich. Regardless of what the situation was, there is no absolutely no reason for an employee to be screaming at a customer the way this employee was berating this man, but the fact that it was over pickles makes it even worse.

The food is pretty good here, but this isn't the first unpleasant experience I've had with the employees there, and there is enough good food in the area to keep me from eating there again until they are able to hire some employee with basic manners.
