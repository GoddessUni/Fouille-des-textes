My husband and I were so excited that there was a new Italian place opening up so close to our place... We went the first weekend they opened and the food and drinks were great. The second time, not so much. I got food poisoning and was violently ill for three days. I called the restaurant just to notify them, and the manager insisted on sending me a gift card for the trouble... about a week later, I received a $25 gift card in the mail... doesn't come close to making up for three days of being extremely ill, and furthermore our meal cost over $100 including our bottle of wine. Though the gesture was kind, I cannot say that a $25 gift card warrants a return to Cucina Pazzo.
