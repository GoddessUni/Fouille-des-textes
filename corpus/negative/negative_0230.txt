Having heard good reviews about this restaurant we decided to give it a try at 4:30 Friday. We wanted to sit in the bar but all seats at the bar were filled. We asked the hostess if we might sit at a table in the bar area noting they were all empty. She said they were all reserved and the next opening would be 8:00pm. 
Are you kidding? There was no one at any table in the restaurant and you don't have any open tables at 4:30pm so that we might get a quick bite?
While I understand my rating should be based on my overall dining experience, I cannot rate this establishment on anything other than this absurd example of how poorly we were treated. I do not intend to go back to find out if any of the reviews are credible or not.
