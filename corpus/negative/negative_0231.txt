Not at ALL a reflection of my waitress, who was very nice. When we went to sit down, my boyfriend didn't want pizza, so the staff was very aware he was leaving to grab what he wanted and come back. I guess the manager wasn't though, because when he returned with his food (which he walked across the entire airport and stood in line to get, and then walked all the way back) the manager (I'm assuming based on his tone and attitude) started literally YELLING at him for bringing "outside food" to sit with a paying customer at a literal AIRPORT. Never seen anything like that in my life. Not to mention the pizza was only okay. I've literally had better frozen pizza. My drink was also over $12 but it's strong so I'm not complaining. The atmosphere and the quality of food is not good enough for him to be so strict on him bringing a breakfast sandwich in, let alone for him to actually yell and raise his voice about it. He could have had the decency to walk over and politely explain it to him like ANYONE with good customer service skills would do. Didn't sit well with me at all.
