I don't like writing bad reviews, it's just not my style. Everyone has an off day. I don't like to harp on people for it. But my experience at el molinito was the WORST dining ever. 

To start, I walk in and the host is gabbing with his friend (who appears to not work there). He does not look at me, doesn't say anything until I walk right up to him and say "2 please". He points to a table and says "that ok?". Doesn't walk us to it, doesn't bring us menus, nothing. 

We sit and are brought chips and salsa and I have to ask for a menu. Now let me stop here, because the chips and salsa are great. And the margaritas are also excellent. 

So we order our food and it comes out quickly. The waitress only brings one side of rice and forgot the guacamole. Ok, no big deal, I'll ask her when she comes back, right? Except she doesn't come back! For 25 minutes we sit and eat, waiting for the rest of our order, no drink refills, no nothing. Finally I snag another waiter and ask for a refill. He attempts to cover for his co-worker by saying they are short a waiter today. That may be, but if that is the case, she shouldn't have been standing, literally 4 feet behind me chatting with the host and his friend. 

So I pack up what was left of my food (chicken burrito) which was delicious and decided maybe next time I will get take out. Before I leave I use the restroom. Big mistake! It looks like it hasn't been cleaned in months, and smells like sewage. 

I get home and heat up my burrito for dinner. Take one bite and bite down on a chicken bone!!! A Bone! If that's not bad enough, I picked apart the rest of it and found 2 more bones. Thank god a child wasn't eating this, they could have choked and died! 

I used to think this place had great food but bad service, but after this, never again. NEVER!
