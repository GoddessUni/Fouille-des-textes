I moved to this area in September of 2015. It is July 2017. Not once have they been able to serve me a chicken sandwich. They are always apparently out of buns. I'll stop by about once a week just to see if they can make me a sandwich. First thing when they open, middle of the afternoon, about an hour before they close, they never have buns.

They also never seem to have spicy anything. If you ask it will always be a no answer. I don't understand why they bother to post their menu at all if they refuse to make half of it.

I understand that things can be sold out. Life happens. Every time though?
