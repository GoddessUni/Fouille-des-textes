This place well defines Philadelphia. The people are unhappy, the prices are in an indirect correlation to the value for the goods, and they trap you because the place next door is even worse. We really wanted to have a relaxed meal after one of those brutal travel days and it only added fuel to the fire by stopping in here. You will see it too. If you have to stay at the DT Hawthorne Suites and it is after 7 pm - you will be here. I hope for your sanity that you get through it and thank your lucky stars that you don't have to live in this part of the country.
