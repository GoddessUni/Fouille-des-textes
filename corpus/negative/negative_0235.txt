So sad to say that this place has gone completely down hill for me. I had not been there in over 8 months, and had noticed on their social media that they cancelled their weekly lunch buffet so they only have it on Fridays. Apparently it was just not cost effective so they couldn't keep doing it every day. The one star review does not take this in to account, as I totally understand a business having to do what they need to do to survive. Cooking a bunch of food for a buffet just for it to go to waste is not a smart business move and I get that. It did lead to me not being able to go back again until recently, however, as in principal I only get Indian food when it's a buffet (I like being able to eat as much of it as I like, and too many Indian places offer lunch buffets to not get it that way). Unfortunately, after having gone back last Friday, I probably won't go back again. 

My biggest problem I had upon going back to A Spicy Affair was FLAVOR. Indian food is known for having spice. I felt like the dishes on the buffet had none. The butter chicken was flavorless. The other chicken dishes, too, tasted like they were totally lacking spices. I was disappointed that all the chicken dishes besides the butter chicken was mixed in with vegetables this time around as well. I prefer just sauce and protein. There are plenty of veggie dishes for people who like vegetables, that I don't know why the meat dishes have to have all these veggies mixed in now as well. This was not the case when I first went there. Even these dishes had no spice to them as well though. All in all disappointing. 

I'm really unsure what happened. Did they tone down some of the spice from opening to accommodate some of the sweedsboro locals who are unfamiliar with Indian food? I suppose if that's what the locals want once again they need to do what they do. But as for me, I probably will go back to going over the Bridge to Delaware for quality Indian food. Disappointed.
