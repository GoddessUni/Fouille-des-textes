I honestly don't know how this store remains open. I anticipate with the opening of the Meijer on Keystone, and the fact that there is a Kroger, Aldi, and Target all on the same road, this location will have to close down at some point.

Marsh is very overpriced on everything they sell. The prices aren't even close to competitive with any of the grocery stores in the area. For the prices they charge for grocery items, you might as well go to the Fresh Market down the street and enjoy the scenery of the beautiful interior of their store.

The selection of items at this location leaves a lot to be desired for as well. I used to frequent the Marsh downtown when I lived in Fountain Square, and I was able to find everything I was looking for. They have a tiny produce section at this location, and aside from almond and soy milk, sell very little vegan or vegetarian specialty foods here.
