Dirt and crumbs, dirt and empty sugar packets, endless dirt and crumpled straw wrappers. This place is the worst Panera I've ever been to. The carpets are weeping to be replaced. It's not even funny. Dirty dishes stacked high above the silverware bin. Dirty cleaning towels everywhere else but where they belong. The music is a joke - BACK to the drawing board!!! Dirt all behind the sullen seat cushions. And the workers, the poor heroic workers... Are they making a living wage!? Do they deserve it!!!? If you've got time to be on your cracked screen smartphone, you've got time to TAKE SOME PRIDE AND KEEP THE PLACE CLEAN!!!!!!! I'm convinced a rotation of homeless people *live* here. A/C vents dirty & disgusting. Lightning... is actually great. Work on the carpet to save this place. I can't even..... I'm gagging at how utterly filthy it is. Bathrooms are okay. I'm grossed out by these sad floors.... Please revive this once great spot!
