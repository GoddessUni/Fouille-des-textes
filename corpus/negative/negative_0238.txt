I'm sure this place is better for the lunch buffet but wow dinner got expensive fast, especially when they offer you more naan but don't say that you'll be charged for another order, cool cool cool... dinner wasn't even that good, butter chicken lacked flavor, garlic naan was undercooked and squishy, and kheer tasted a little sour honestly but if I'm gonna drop $20 for dinner I'm gonna eat it all I guess. Anyway probably won't come back unless it's for the buffet and even then I'm tempted to travel further up State St to the other Indian place in town.
