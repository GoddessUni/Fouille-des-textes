Usually I love Buffalo Wild Wings because of their dry rubs, but when I went today it was horrible. They put absolutely no rub on my wings. When I told my waiter, Jovic, he was very apologetic and took them back to get fresh ones. A woman manager came back with a horrible face and bought me the same wings that they just sprinkled seasoning on. There was still no seasoning on more than half. Jovic was the only good part of this experience with his excellent customer service. As far as management goes, I wish I could give them zero stars. It was an overall bad experience and way over priced for the quality I received.
