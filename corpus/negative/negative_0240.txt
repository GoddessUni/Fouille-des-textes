I never write reviews of this as I hate to criticize an establishment or people but eating here tonight (Dec 24th) was absolutely awful. Waited two hours for our food, portions were tiny and cold. Waiter refused to bring more water, didn't come by once to ask how our food was or if we needed anything.  For the food being so expensive, it may not taste very good but at least hire a waiter that can at least act for a few minutes that he/she enjoys their job. We asked questions about the menu, and he would answer them describing what the menu said about them.  Management and the people downstairs seemed very friendly but the waiter/ service and quality of food was just awful. Disappointed!
