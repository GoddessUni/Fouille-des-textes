I tried to eat at the Cafe Deluxe for lunch today, and it did not go very well. When I walked in I stood there for a little while trying to figure out whether I should seat myself or wait to be seated. After two minutes of not being acknowledged and finding no sign or indication, I elected to seat myself at the counter. It was about 1:30pm, not very busy and I counted 5 employees. I sat for a little over 10 minutes without being acknowledged. I tried to make eye contact with employees.... but the few times that happened, they looked away and continued to ignore me. I know I could have been obnoxious and been noticed.. but really when there is a counter, ony 3 people at that counter, several employees behind the counter... I should not have to work to get someone's attention.

There was a feeling that maybe I wasn't cool enough to be there... no tats or piercings. Maybe I am just not hipster enough for this kinda place.

After 10 minutes of sitting there looking foolish, I left. No one said goodbye to me either.

I will be back... hoping that my experience was some weird anomaly. The menu looked great, as did the prices, and clearly other diners did not share my experience. As a vegan, I need someplace to go. Reno is getting better, but really needs the help.
