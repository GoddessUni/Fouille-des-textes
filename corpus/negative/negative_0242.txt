We were a party of 7 celebrating my parents 60th anniversary. I had requested a table that had a nice atmosphere. We were seated at a table in the front room that seemed to have been lit by the odd gas lamp. It was next to impossible to see each other let alone the menu or food. I don't know what the objective was except perhaps to seem as though the room exuded "colonial charm" instead of shining a light on how very dated it is. The food was ok, not bad and not exceptional, and the service spotty. I was disappointed especially since this was a happy occasion, we were all dressed, but could barely see each other and it was impossible to take photos.
