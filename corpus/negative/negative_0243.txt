We usually love this location, the service is excellent, and so is the food. However, when we ate there yesterday, we had a bad experience. Our server was excellent, as usual, but my husband ordered the steak and eggs. He ordered his steak medium rare, and when it came out, it was really rare. I didn't see it, or I would have told him to send it back. He doesn't mind rare steak, so he ate it anyway. He said later the steak was barely warm. Well, to make a long story short, his stomach was really upset later, and I think it was from the steak. No more steak and eggs from Peg's!
