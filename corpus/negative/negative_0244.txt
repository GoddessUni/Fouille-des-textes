First time ordering from here and let me tell you this place is worst place for Latin food and customer service I ordered thru Grubhub my driver came on time but one item was missing i call the restaurant and the lady told me there's nothing can be done she had the nerves to tell me i needed to call the driver for him to come back and pickup up the missing order, That is not the driver responsibility than she said ( wait a minute i have it here) like is not a big deal than she saids you can come and pick it up your self, Im still in shock of how the situation was handle i cant imagine their food, on top of all the frustration we couldn't even ate the moro rice due been extremely salty and the meet looked old. Im definitely reporting them. Extremely disappointed.
