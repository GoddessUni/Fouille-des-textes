Visiting from out of town on my anniversary. Hostess was leaning on the stand on her phone, headphones in. Took us to a table, set the menus down and said "someone will be with you." And walked away. Headphones never left her ears. She continues to walk around the restaurant with headphones in. Got ignored for a good 2-3 mins, the sever comes up, says "what can i get you to drink?" Takes our order and walks away abruptly. Comes back, takes order, doesnt ask for sides or anything, and disappears. We dont have chips or salsa and i havent seen him since. Seems like theres other servers that are good around us, as people are being served and i see them more than once. Id give the servers name except he never introduced himself. The manager just walked by us and acted like we didnt exist. The server put the food down and walked away, not asking if we needed anything else. The table near us sat for 5+ minutes before being greeted and another 5 for their drinks. My steak fajitas is overcooked. The burger my boyfriend had was covered in grisle and his fries had chunks of chicken in it. Im a server and i cant believe im saying this but im not even going to give the server the benefit of the doubt. Yikes. We just want to leave and never come back!
