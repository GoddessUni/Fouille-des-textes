Have visited 20 plus times but tonight will be my last. The wait staff was great as always. Beer selection ok. Food was good but over priced. Management is terrible.

Offered last week to put down a substantial amount of money to reserve tables for a large party which was refused. Even after we said the money would be lost if all did not show up on time. Tonight nearly our entire party was present but we were not seated until everyone was here. While we were waiting, management rudely yelled at us to stop crowding other patrons. Sorry that you refused to seat us with 10 people present. Where did you want us to go?

There are plenty of other restaurants in Indianapolis who have a better beer selection with more reasonable food prices. I will be spending my money there. Customer is always right? Not at Shoefly.
