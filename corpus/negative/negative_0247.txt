Just Ok in my opinion. Service was good but the food was overpriced for what they were offering and the drinks were way too expensive. Living in a place like DC you are used to high prices, but brunch -- and in New Orleans -- I'm not paying $8 for a mimosa that is not going unlimited.

It's just not happening. You can't charge that much for a cocktail down there when you aren't giving more then a champagne flute. I think that they price because they are on Jackson Square and they know a lot of tourists will stop in during their mornings. 

Our group left un impressed with their fair.
