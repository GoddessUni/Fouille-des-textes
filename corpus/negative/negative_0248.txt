Avoid at all costs (no pun intended) because money is their number one priority.  Horrible staff, no communication with me until the bill was ready - and came out $2000 over their original quote - this is simply a profit center. I've asked around and everyone I've spoken with has had a similarly bad experience.  I just took my dog to a vet outside Stone Harbor in cape may county - he is from South Carolina and has heard all about this place - apparently their bad reputation is well known.. So do yourself a huge favor and go somewhere else.
