I have been here many times. A few years back it was great. Now its terrible. Each time it declined more and more drastically. The servers are rude. The food is not consistent. Sometimes it is good and other times it is just very bad. You can't complain they will argue with you. They don't understand what customer service it. Why spend money where you are treated bad? Today I went and I didn't know they close earlier than the time listed. The lady at the front very rudely said Okay sooo the kitchen closes soon. BUT if you know what you're gonna eat you can still order. And advised us of how quick we had to be. I told her online it showed they were open for over an hour. She told me no be fast.... This was the last straw. I will just continue to go to Mi Ranchito. Where I can get awesome consistent food, customer service and not get treated like crap. Why pay money for a place that clearly doesn't want your business. 

Just another tip... They get attitudes when you use coupons. Even though they are their coupons. I just won't bother with this place again.
