As a USF student, I've had taco bus a few times & always enjoyed their quesadillas, chips & queso. However, upon my previous (and very last) visit, I was disgusted to get home with my to-go order, open the box & see a COCKROACH scurry out. My boyfriend & I promptly tossed the food and called the restaurant to complain about what happened. With no manager in at the time (ordered at night), an employee named Crystal told us we would just have to wait until the next morning to come in and have a manger refund us since we paid with card. She sounded unconcerned, was unapologetic & overall displayed horrible customer service. We brought the receipt with us the next day to meet the manager (who wasn't in once again), but thankfully a male employee was able to refund us. This also told me that Crystal was capable of the refund but couldn't be bothered to do it for us if we came back the night before. The man who helped us with our refund was kind enough to offer a free replacement meal, but knowing the state of the kitchen/restaurant after that, we said a polite Hell no! 

*Note: when I logged in to write this, I noticed another review for this location stating there was a cockroach in their meal too...YIKES!!
