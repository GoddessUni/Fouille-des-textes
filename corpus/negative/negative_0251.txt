We decided to give this place a try for lunch on Valentine's Day... big mistake. They advertised a 15.99 special that included lobster, steak, and all kinds of other goodies. They didn't have any of that. I was a little annoyed by the false advertisement but got over it because they had my fave (crawfish). What really got to me was the BLATANT DISCRIMINATION towards anyone who looked young. They sat the people we walked in with immediately but then tried to make us pay before we sat. One of the men working said no and had them seat us first, but then another group came in shortly after and watched the people in front of them be sat only to be told they needed to pay first. I understand being concerned you won't be paid but you don't get to pick and choose who pays first and who pays once they've eaten. Needless to say we won't be back. We have better buffets at home that don't jack up there prices for a "holiday", serve delicious food, and don't discriminate against young looking people.
