So very disappointing. I heard nothing but good reviews and that it is a must not miss in Nashville....I'm not sure how anyone could say this was good..it was terrible. I can't believe they have more than one location.  

The ribs were very over cooked and dried out...the sauce was nothing special...the fries were cold and soggy and tasteless...the potato salad was ok with a bit of a kick but was room temp not cold so I didn't trust to eat it. $30 for two rib meals and we couldn't even finish because it was so bad and didn't bother taking leftovers (which I've never left food behind).
