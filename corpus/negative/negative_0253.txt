The first time we tried to eat here we left. After waiting almost 20mins in the drive thru we left. Tried again today. Got the food and I think it was worse than not getting the food. It's crazy expensive but whatever. The bigger issue is the quality and service. It was like we were bothering them by trying to give them our money. Awful service is a product of awful management. I wouldn't go back to this place if they gave away the food for free. Wait for the chick fil a to open and maybe they can stop by and see what real customer service and quality food should be like. They should be ashamed charging what they do for what they provide. If you're starving to death still do not eat here.
