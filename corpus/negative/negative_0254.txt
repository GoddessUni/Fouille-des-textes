If you make reservations online via their website and the hostess didn't see it before 6pm, you don't get your reserved seats? Well, don't offer that ability if you aren't going to honor it, supposedly we got seating because another party didn't show. There was plenty of seats available. I didn't understand the table dancing, they allowed guests with or without shoes to dance on top of empty tables, then seat newly arriving guests at them without the guest knowing that stinky feet was all over their plates and silverware.  Our waiter shows up sweating like he just finished The 3 Day Walk (60 miles) or he was on crank? You order hummus but it never arrives until we ask for it 3 times and it finally gets to the table, but it's self making? They give you a mortar & pestle, chickpeas, oil and garlic. I didn't want to make my dinner, that's why I paid to eat at a restaurant. I had the beef kabobs, it was cooked perfectly but could've used more spices. The pita bread had more salt on it than the Dead Sea.  We ordered the sangria, highly recommended by the waiter, it was $25 for red wine in a pitcher. There was nothing sangria about it. The place was loud, like dance club shouting in your friends ear loud.  The belly dancer had more belly than dancing.  I say OPA and Ai gamisou! I'm never recommending or returning to this place.
