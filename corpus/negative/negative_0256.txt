Very unimpressed with this place.  
We went for brunch one Saturday and I ordered the Vegan Blue Plate Breakfast.  The tofu scramble was dry and bland, the vegan sausages were so dry and rubbery they had to have been sitting under a heat lamp for hours (there's no way they were cooked to order) and they didn't have a vegan "butter" spread for the toast so it too was dry.
Our waiter was extremely snooty.  When I asked for soy milk or an alternative to regular cream for my coffee, he looked down his nose at me and said "Hmpf, NOBODY drinks soy milk anymore"  What a pompous ass!!  
The decor is dingy and kind of sad, really.  It's loud, dark and gloomy.  

I don't understand why this place has line-ups out the door.  It's just gross.
