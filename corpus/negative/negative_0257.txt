I almost never visit this particular Cora if I can help it. It's not the food, it's the service. There is one waitress who works here who never ceases to frustrate me. Even as she's taking your order, she begins walking off nodding as you get to the end, so doesn't hear all the extras. 

The first time we visited this location, I asked for a side of Swiss cheese with my Peggy's Poached. She thought I said "cream cheese" (becuse she was walking away at the time) and brought me this hunk of white stuff, so I had to correct her and make her bring the correct type. 

She aso brought the wrong kind of toast. I asked for multigrain, and she brought white.  

The last time, she just started filling my coffee cup before asking if I would like a refill. To other people, this may not seem like a big deal. But for me, it's huge. I'm on Weight Watchers, and unfortunately, I can't drink black coffee (which has no points). I hadn't yet finished the one cup I'd allotted for myself, and the points for the milk and sugar additions I had to add. 

I explained WHY she should always ASK before filling someone's cup, because it's not always a good thing. Also, lady, take the time to LISTEN to your customers' orders, and write everything DOWN so you get it right! 

I always have decent service at the location on 137th Ave, so that's where I'll continue to go.
