Below average food at expensive prices. They charge for extra rolls which is like huh?  My roast turkey looked like lunch meat, the cranberry sauce portion to be laughed at. I rather have a substantial meal then all the extras. So offer soup or salad for your meal and offer a better meal. The only thing I did like here was my salad, my rolls and my pudding. The food is just not good not for the price paid. I my seems another restaurant in this area cheap down their meals to make more money. I get lure at the area ethnic restaurants.
