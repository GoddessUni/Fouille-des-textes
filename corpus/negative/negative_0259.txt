Went to this place yesterday. The food was ok. My wife order ara√±itas but they were dry. The shrimp was missing flavor. I order empanadas de carne (beef empanadas) and they were drenched in cooking oil on the inside. The meat was flavorless. At the time to pay the ticket I gave my credit card to the attendant and she brought the tablet for me to sign at the table. When I asked where was my credit card, she seemed irate and began to explain with attitude the procedure of how their system worked. Needless to say, won't be returning here.
