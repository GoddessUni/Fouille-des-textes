Forced to select a star in order to post, but this place gets a ZERO STAR.
Ordered a taco salad minus the rice. What I received was a burnt taco shell with RICE (lots of it), no beans, about a tablespoon of meat sitting off to the side, and a plop of sour cream in the middle. Drove back with untouched salad, waited at counter about 10 minutes for someone to talk to and issue me a refund (after person manning the drive-thru window noticed me and had to call for someone to wait on me). Worst Taco Bell I've ever been to. Probably explains why there's hardly any cars in parking lot whenever passing by.
