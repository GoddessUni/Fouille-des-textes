Ok so I am a true foody or fatty lol. The food was ok. The mac and cheese was really good. Service could of been much better. They brought my friends food out first and then i had to wait 6 minutes before they brought mines out. So now im angry cause she is eating her food in front of me while my stomach is growling! Then we asked does it come with cornbread and they said that would be extra. But she said our meals come with bread......And yet they brought no bread out with our meals. I would not go back but the food was not bad.
