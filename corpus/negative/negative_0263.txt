Sidenote: the best cup of coffee I've had in CWE is at Pi Pizza. Great dark roast. 

Review: 

Sigh. 

I would really like to rate the cartel higher. I enjoy my share of coffee shops and have hipster tendencies (eg riding a fixed gear), but it's hard to rate the cartel more than 2 stars. It could be argued that the coffee shop is misplaced in the CWE and belongs in a neighborhood more like The Grove. 

That said, a certain niche of people would rate this place 6 stars and so I'll highlight some of the positives and negatives. 

5 star qualities: Open 24/7. Only coffee shop I am aware of that is open late (past midnight/1am)....and it is open the whole night. For academics, this is amazing. 

4 star qualities: It appeals to a different crowd than the Starbucks world. Almost to a fault...

3 star qualities: ...It tries too hard to appeal to a different crowd than the Starbucks world. Almost like that little brother who is doing things not because he likes to do them but because he knows his older brother wouldn't like it. 

2 star qualities: Their coffee isn't good nor their espresso beans. I bought a fresh fruit smoothie once. It was 6ish dollars (which is fine for fresh fruit)...unfortunately, it was frozen fruit and not very tasty. Their ice cream is Edy's which is great for what it is, but it is priced like it were home made. May the location forces the prices up; however, it would be nice if they were like other CWE businesses that find ways to not sacrifice quality along the way. 

1 star qualities: Stinky. Literally stinky. And filthy bathrooms. My clothes smell anytime I am their for longer than an hour. I think it has to go with their 5 star quality of being open 24/7 combined with their staff who all have really cool personalities and interesting stories albeit questionable work ethics. 

Conclusion: If I'm gonna smell bad and have a less than average meal, I'd prefer to go bowling.
