Three of us had Sunday lunch at Season 52 today and the service was horrible.  We approached the hostess station and waited a couple minutes because the hostess was on the phone, no problem.  We finally got seated and waited fifteen minutes without anyone coming over to welcome us or take our drink orders.  After a man in his jacket walked by us three times we excused ourselves and asked if he could find our server.  Apparently that was a manager that did not notice we were sitting there for fifteen minutes on a slow Sunday without being helped.

After our waiter (Michael) apologized for the "mis-communication" between him and the hostess we ordered.  The food came out quick and was just OK.  He never came back to check on us although he only had one other table.  He spent most of his time polishing wine glasses.  We did wave him down and ask for more bread for the soup.  He said, "sure, I can get that for you" and never came back.  

When we finished eating, another server passing by noticed our dishes sitting there for awhile and cleared our table.  

The manager approached us and apologized for our wait and said dessert was on him.  We ordered dessert to find that it was on our bill anyway.   

We asked to see a manager and never got to see one.  

Overall, we went for a quick soup and salad Sunday lunch and ended up being there for an hour and a half.  

I was extremely disappointed with the customer service which is a disappointment because the ambiance of this restaurant has great potential.
