This giant is horrible on the weekend, and weeknights. You have some alright staff, but most of them are just inconsiderate and could care less. I was just there yesterday, and the cashier BARELY paid attention to me and another woman that was at the end of the register was just plain nasty. When I used to come here a while ago, it was never like this.

Forget management, they are also inconsiderate and incredibly arrogant. The tall one with the black hair is very rude, and the night manager is a joke. Its a shame because this Giant is particularly close to me, and I would enjoy going here if it was not for the negative atmosphere each time I walk in. I will not shop here, I will go out of my way to go to a store that is friendly, clean, and can get people out in a timely manner.
