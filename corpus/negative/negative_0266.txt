Came here with a group of women.  This by far was the worst service I have ever had.  I come here often and have never had service this bad.  It started off when I asked for seperate checks (5) in total. The waitress (chenelle) rolled her eyes and said it would take a long time for her to do that.  I am a gm of a restaurant and was shocked at her response.  After we got through that, our meals came out sporadic.  I got my food and one by one everyone eventually got their food.  I asked for a steak knife as mine was taken away with my salad, I actually used the bread knife since it took forever to get a knife and I wanted to eat hot food.  Our salads came and the dressing wasn't on the side as requested but the waitress never came back so I asked a different waiter to get me a new salad and he did.  Never saw the waitress during our meal.  When one of the ladies asked for dessert the waitress got her dessert and neglected to get anyone elses.  When I asked her for dessert she took the rest of our orders and brought everyone's but mine and started to clean tables.  I did finally get my dessert.  With all this being said our checks were wrong and the manager had to come talk to us in reference to a coupon we had.   I explained to her how bad the service was and she was very apologetic.   It wasn't that busy and I do believe she would have known how unhappy we were if she did table touches.  The manager did do her best in apologies (Christie Ann) but unfortunately it was not enough!!!  However the food was good!!! What a shame to have service ruin it..
