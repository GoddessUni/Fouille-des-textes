I took my mom and grandma here for lunch on a Friday. I'm embarrassed that I took them here! The coleslaw was the worst we ever had. My grandma upgraded to the onion rings, they were not cooked all the way. We all upgraded and paid extra for our fish to be cod ( I promise you it was not cod delivered) once we were done and stacked our plates on the edge of the table we waited for 23 min for the waitress to finally bring out bill ( mind you she even came over once when we were done and ignored the plates with silverware and dirty napkins on them) There were only 2 other tables at the time so they were not busy. Needless to say we will never go back here!
