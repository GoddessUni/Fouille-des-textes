Went for lunch today. While the service was good, music selection and volume level acceptable, the food was disappointing. 
My wife ordered the teriyaki chicken dish. The chicken was thin chicken pieces, rather than a grilled breast sliced. There was too much sauce which tasted premade as opposed to made in-house. 
I ordered the tempura udon. The tempura included three shrimp, a potato slice, yam slice and zucchini slice. A nice mix, but the vegetables were cut a bit thick. The batter was a bit heavy and crunchy. Not the light panko batter. The soup seemed like a basic, light chicken stock. Didn't taste homemade. 
Needless to say, we were a little disappointed this time. 
Rated two stars this time, down from four stars last time.
