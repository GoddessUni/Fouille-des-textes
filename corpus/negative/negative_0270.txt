It had been quite sometime since I had visited Rice's, so I set out early on a warm, sunny Saturday morning in search of bargains!  Actually, what I really needed was some new reading glasses.  There are a couple of vendors who sell really cool, inexpensive reading glasses (much better than the stuff you see in drug stores, discount stores, etc.).  I actually have about 20 pair, and need to update my eyeglass wardrobe.  I was somewhat dissapointed -- I could only find two vendors who I would say have "quality" or "fashionable" eyewear.  The rest was crap.  I did find one pair.  I do like the fashion jewelry -- some nice silver and costume pieces, and the prices are pretty fair.  Picked up a few baubles.  

Other than that, I was completely uninspired and unimpressed.  There was not much else there that appealed to me.  I have not been to Rice's on a Tuesday in years, so maybe that's a better bet.  I will likely not be visiting Rice's on a Saturday anytime soon, it's just not worth it anymore.
