This is the worst McDonald's in the entire world. I downloaded yelp and wrote this review while waiting for my food. I've been here a few times because it's closest to my house, and the drive through is ridiculously slow. Tonight I decided I'd see if it was quicker to go inside. Nope. They literally don't take people's orders. Instead they tell you to use the one working kiosk. Also people beg you to buy them food, which is uncomfortable (and made my order cost twice as much). 45 minutes later, I'm finally out. I will never go back to this awful place.
