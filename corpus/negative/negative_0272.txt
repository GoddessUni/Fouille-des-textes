We had pizza, knotted bread and two kinds of salads. Each was as tasteless as the next item.  The crust is sooooo bland--it's similar to some stuff we uesd to make when we were kids, Chef Boy Ardee? That does not seem to be the correct spelling, but believe me, it is pasty and bland as white Wonder bread. The sauce? Uhm...no. Very little of it and equally as bland as the crust with very few ingredients on top. Salads?  Uhm...again, nothing tasty. A tiny hint of blue cheese, a bland dressing and so little to eat. Unlike some people, we eat, not drink, our meals. By the way, we got all of this to go because we were working late. We could not get no satisfaction at this place. I was surprised to find that this place is run by one of Racanelli's (of Racanelli's pizza) brothers. He needs to learn from his bro--this place is a no-go.

I'd let it go, but sorry--we work hard for our money and do not like wasting it on bad food. If I buy a shirt from Macy's that I don't like or that falls apart, I get a refund!  Restaurants like this need to be aware of this.  DO NOT RIP US OFF!  Maybe the other food items are better, but do you think we will return to gamble away another $50? Nope.
