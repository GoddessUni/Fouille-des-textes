First off, I want to say that in the past their cheesesteaks have been pretty good.  I'm not sure what happened today, I am confused and a little bit sad.  Delivery took about an hour at one o'clock in the afternoon on a Wednesday, that's a little long but not my main beef here.  The main beef would be that my steak tasted like sand was added as a topping.  I thought maybe it was just a bad bite so I took another, same thing.  I took a bite of the other half and got the same thing.  Not edible.  I have eaten way too much cheesesteaks in my day and not once have I abandoned one after three bites.  I want to solve the sandy cheesesteak mystery except I don't want to solve the sandy cheesesteak mystery.
