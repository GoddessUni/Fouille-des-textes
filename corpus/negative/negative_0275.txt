I've eaten here twice now and based on my experiences it's really about a 2.5. The service is good bc they're friendly and accommodating but even with 3 people waiting on you, we had to wait alot and it wasn't busy as it was mid afternoon. It's the food that really gets the 2.5. It is very blah. Honestly I can't even remember what I had either time. It was definitely fish bc I don't eat land animals but obviously if I can't even remember then it wasn't that good. I know my husband tried some form of meat and he was highly unimpressed and said I could've made it better. It was disappointing bc Emeril is this famous chef and you would just expect that anything you order is gonna knock your socks off and it didn't by a long shot. We both left very disappointed each time but when you're hungry and you know better sometimes the hunger pains get in the way of judgment. I would not give this place a 3rd try.
