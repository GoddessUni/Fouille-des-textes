#fatjared say...some good, but more bad!

First off...this is NOT fast food. It takes a while to get to you and there is no drive through so IMO CANT be considered fast food! Second...if you are a burger place you should have the burgers automatically come with fries! One of my friends didnt get any because the people didn't mention it didnt automatically come with them, and by that time the line was too long to go back and order some. Also the special sauce they had came out almost frozen. The way you get your food is a bit off and it took a while. 

On another note, the fries were crispy which is good, and the burger itself was cooked well, not too thin, and had a great flavor. I also tried the shroom burger which was great! The shakes were a bit melted by the time they got to you, but were delicious!

It's hard to separate yourself as an outstanding burger. This place had a bit above average burger, BUT the menu, the line, the people, the experience was below average. You have to catch them at the right time to have an outstanding experience here.
