I had such high hopes but am leaving woefully disappointed. We ordered at the same time that we ordered our drinks but an hour later, we were still waiting on our salads.  When we queried the waitress she fessed up to giving our salads to another table. We ordered a large pizza but when our pizza came and it was a small instead of a rage, our waitress' response is that she heard is say "small". Other than the $5 pitchers of beer, there wasn't much redeeming about the food or our experience here.  With this being our last night in NOLA we were hoping to have a nice meal but we are leaving sorely disappointed.
