I was cautiously optimistic about MKT for months prior to their opening due to their expected large draft selection. I'm a beer geek and with many taps on offer, I was hoping that the selection wasn't going to be all InBev or MolsonCoors and mostly it's not. Granted those companies beers are all over the menu, but finding micro and craft brews in the list isn't too difficult. I was happy that there were some guest/rotational taps on offer too.

Opening night was a fiasco, and I won't delve too deeply into what hopefully were teething problems and opening night jitters. The stand out problem from the opening night, a Thursday, was having ads plastered all over the restaurant and washrooms of $4 pints on Thursdays, and then charging full price. That didn't do much for this places credibility.

I've been back since the opening night and feel I can properly give this place a review. I don't care for the beer groups on the menu, much preferring the beer to be separated by style, but I recognize that they're not catering to me. Who they are catering to with this style of beer menu, I still don't know. So, finding a beer I want to drink is a bit of a pain.

The prices are a bit expensive when you compare the prices to the serving sizes which are generally 400mL or less (not a full pint). If they had an awesome selection, then it would be worth the premium but the selection is at best average. If you come on a Thursday, however, then you're getting a bargain.

I'm glad I didn't get too excited about this place before it opened because I think they missed the mark. I feel Edmonton is ready for a full on beer geek type space but this appears to just be a trendy place to be seen.
