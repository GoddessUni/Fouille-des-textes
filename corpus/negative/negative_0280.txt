I was going to rip this place a new one.... but seeing all the other reviews.... it seems they have already been ripped. I went through he drive thru the other day with 3 cars in front of me. IT TOOK 40 MINUTES. No bull, 40. My order was 5 items.... after finally waiting with my two small children in the car, I am given the completely wrong order. I furiously parked, got my kids out and went inside. There were other customers asking for their money back as they were not served in time and needed to get back to work. All I wanted was a refund.... no apologies. I did hear and excuse that there was large orders in front of people and that's why it was taking so long. ABSOLUTE LIE. The best course of action that day would to put a sign out that says "we are unable to serve lunch today". People don't go to Taco Bell to wait 40 minutes. I will never go to this location again and I hope they get the help the need badly.
