Well we decided to give this chili's another shot after being let down the last few times but we really enjoy the salsa and fajitas. When we walked in , it took about 5 minutes before we were seated and then even longer to get our order taken. There was a table of about 20 to the right of us and I shoulda got up and left right then because I knew the service wasn't gonna be great. Well our queso was cold and our fajitas were warm at best  to the point where we could grab the skillet handle. I mentioned to the server and he apologized and was very honest with us about this restaurant being full of problems. Understaffed and inexperienced workers in his opinion and sadly we are done w Chili's until the Spring Hill one opens up and then we will give that one a try...
