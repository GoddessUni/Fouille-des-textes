Met with coworkers from different cities in advance of a company meeting, dining early (4:30 pm Tuesday) due to air travel.  Our group of 5 was literally the only occupied table, while there was a small number of people at the bar.  Asked our server if there were drink specials. "NO." Then questioned about it being happy hour.  "That only applies if you are at the bar or seated outside" (in the steady rain).  So wait...we aren't part of happy hour because we are seated 15 feet away, at the sole occupied table?  "NO".  Ruined the meal experience, and we left immediately after eating.  Management FAIL.  The food was good enough to earn back the second star, but experience wise, it was a one star.
