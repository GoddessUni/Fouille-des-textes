We didn't even check the reviews because we thought we'd know what to expect from a chain we're familiar with...big mistake. Service was ok, although we waited quite a while to order given the place was almost empty. Still debating +/-on being asked to hold off on our beer to get the happy hour price (it was 3 minutes away.. and didn't get our beer until 10 minutes after the start of happy hour?). For a place that specializes in wings, it's disappointing that the wings seem like they're cooked ahead of time with just a sauce slapped on them. The buffalo chips came out with no "buffalo" on them and nuked american cheese (we sent them back, only to return with what looked like bay seasoning sprinkled on them and returned..not to mention the "chips" looked nuked too so we sent them away (and we're not picky people). Not to worry though, as the manager told us they were "on the house". They think they are doing parents a favor with the tablets, but it causes more problems than it solves.  Will not be going back.
