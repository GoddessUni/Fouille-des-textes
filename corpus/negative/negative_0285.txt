This place was a major disappointment. Was in the mood to try a new place but quickly regretted it . The place threw me off from the moment I walked in . I remember even looking back at my cousins asking if they wanted to stay after I saw how the food prepper handled the food , it grossed me out . Nothing is fresh and all in all it's like a basic pizza joint with a fancier dine-in setting . The pizza was really greasy , the oil was dripping and my hands were drenched. The wings smelled off , I bit into one wing and didn't finish the rest .. really subpar quality . Finally, their dessert cookie which I was hoping would be great was simply a mess. I felt I wasted my money . Wouldn't go back, ever .The manager was attentive and seem to have cared but I'm just being honest. The place has really high ratings though, so to each its own ! 


P.S cousins ordered vegan pizza and it was terrible . Not edible at all .
