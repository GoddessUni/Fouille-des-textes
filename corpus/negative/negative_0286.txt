Okay okay I know it's St. Patrick's day but I have to say today's service was amongst the slowest I have ever encountered. We waited forever to get our drinks after getting seated and then we honestly probably waited 30-45minutes for our food to come out which really wasn't good.

After the wait I didn't even want to complain. I ordered bottomless mimosas with my friends and only had two because it took forever to get a drink.

Highly doubt I'll be back which sucks. I honestly think they were short staffed but I have never had such bad service anywhere. My server was amazing but after hearing her apologize for the 100th time I was really sick of it.
