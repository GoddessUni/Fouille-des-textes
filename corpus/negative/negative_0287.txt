We didn't originally want to go to this location winghouse but since it was fight night the rest were packed so we settled for the only place not booked. I went to this bar specifically to watch the fight this weekend, Our waitress sucked and not just her serving but her attitude as well. After having the bad service the power went out, not once..not twice..but three times! The first time it happen kind of early..the second it happened 3 fights away from the main event (the whole reason EVERYONE was there) and the third time was FIVE minutes before the main event, meaning everyone missed the event if they stayed. It was ridiculous. On top of all of that, there were spilled drinks all over the floor that no one bothered really cleaning. So no lights, a crowded restaurant and wet floors, they should just be glad no one hurt themselves. I'm not going back to this place again, and I'd recommend finding somewhere else to watch your sporting events.
