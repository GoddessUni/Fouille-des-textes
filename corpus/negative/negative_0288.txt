I was excited to try this place after a friend highly recommended it. Went to the shop and saw there was somewhat of a line (maybe 7 people in front of us) but we decided to wait anyway. After nearly 30 minutes in line, my boyfriend, friend, and I finally got to the counter where the cashier told us that it would be another hour and a half wait because they had an 18 top ahead of us. We were very frustrated since not only we were very hungry by that point, but the cashier saw us standing in line for nearly 30 minutes and didn't think of the courtesy to let us know that we wouldn't be served. Plus, I was shocked it would take over an hour and a half to make a few crepes since they are famously known to be a quick breakfast option. I would have never even have waited to sit at a fancy Italian restaurant for two hours, much less a quick breakfast place.

I would suggest if you go by the shop and see a line, just don't even bother as you will get incredibly inconsiderate service for an $8 crepe.
