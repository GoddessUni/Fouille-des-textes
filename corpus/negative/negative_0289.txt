Tried this one time.  Trust me...it will be my only time.  Had some family visiting and they saw this place and wanted some bbq.  Got 3 different meats.  The reason for the 2 stars instead of 1, was because the pulled pork was somewhat decent.  The chicken was dry and not very flavorful.  And I might as well have been eating beef jerky as tough as the ribs were.  Actually beef jerky would have been more tender and offered more flavor besides just smoke.  I waited to see what anyone else had to say, and out of 2 kids and 3 other adults, nobody liked this. And my brother-in-law kept apologizing for getting it.
