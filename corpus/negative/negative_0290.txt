Food good, service terrible.  I have never felt so invisible in a restaurant before and it was not like there was a lack of staff, but a lack of coordination.  Why have a host seat you at a table when no one comes to take your order and you yourself have to ask the host if you can order and then let her know again your food is sitting waiting on the counter for someone to bring it to you and then go to the self serve counter to pay??  I only left a tip in the hopes that it would be shared with the people who clear the tables and those in the kitchen, not for the servers who were nonexistent.

It is a shame as we are locals here and thought this would be a regular place for us, but maybe only for takeout or when they work out the kinks on who is covering which section of the restaurant.  

The food is good though and everything is fresh.  I would definitely recommend the avocado toast and any of the fresh pastries.  

Hopefully the manager of this place will look into the service deficit, because the cafe itself is a nice and much needed addition to lower State Street.
