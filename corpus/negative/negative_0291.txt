Sad to rate this place so low but they've earned it. Their food and service used to be excellent.
This time the service was brusk. They only have one flavor of shake at a time. Tonight's was Chai flavor. I get wanting to keep things interesting but would have preferred just chocolate since I was in the mood for a shake and don't have them that often.
But here is the reason for the low rating, they really have one mission -burgers. They were dry. Just awful, certainly not worth the trip. And the topper, they forgot the cheese on my cheeseburger. How do you mess that up. Of course, if I dined in, it would have been easily fixed, but I took our food back to our room so wasn't going to go back down just for a slice of cheese.
