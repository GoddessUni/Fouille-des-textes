I ate here on Monday and I don't know if it was because Mondays are generally slower i get that i am in the industry.  Any how the over view was simply this "wow that was a really good $25 salad bar." 


Food-  Was basically over marinated over cooked cheap meat.  I don't know how many chicken dishes i got cut on to my plate.  Chicken hearts?  OK i love chicken feet...but in order to enjoy chicken feet it must be cooked properly and same goes for chicken hearts... i wanted to ask the kid that was cutting my meat to try it ha ha.  Don't serve it if you wouldn't eat it!!!! The meat was over marinated you could tell because the marinate starts to eat the meat and makes the texture basically acid cooked the meat then they cooked it lol. 

Summary- Just another corporate place in Boise where people don't know better and call it good...... eat local they are the ones who care ultimately because if they go out of business they are done... so there food must taste better than meat on a stick.
