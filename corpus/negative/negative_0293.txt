Just left Bricks Cafe on Nolensville Rd after a lovely 15 minute chat while waiting for our server to bring water. He only walked into our area 4 times to take care of other tables after he asked what we wanted to drink, totally ignoring us. As we were walking out, the hostress did the usual enjoy your evening thing while he was working the register right next to her.  I told her it would have been had we gotten any service, now we have to go elsewhere to eat.  He never turned to look, and she didn't respond.  This is not the first time we have problems at this place.  The last time, I asked for the manager and was given a we don't need your business attitude.  Don't ask me why we went there tonight, but it wont happen again.  They get 1 star because Yelp wont let me give zero!
