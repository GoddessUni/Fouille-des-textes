Terrible.  Went in expecting the worst.. and came out more then disappointed.  Was sat at the bar when i wanted a table... w/e  fine faster service for me.  All i wanted was a bowl of terrible chili because that's the best they can offer so i ordered it... OK chilies doesn't have chili.. go figure... i already prepared myself that that set back..  I order the buffalo chicken sandwich.  with fries.   
It come out... the chicken and fries are overly over fried to the point that they are not crispy but a little hard and almost taste stale yet soft on the inside... but not in a good way.   I ask for hot sauce or anything els they have to spice up my meal...  The only thing they could conjure up was a small bottle of Tabasco sauce... which i am certain is the "buffalo" sauce that they put on my sandwich.  
All in all a terrible meal and i should have gone with my gut instincs and just gone to the burger king.  I only went here because i though i could kill time waiting for my plan and sit at the tables... but they kicked me out 15 min after i got there... and I didn't mind because it was ridiculously cold in the restaurant.
