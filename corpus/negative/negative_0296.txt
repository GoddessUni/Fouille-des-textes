If I could rate zero stars I would. Went here with a group or six, after we ordered a large pizza we asked for drinks. We were informed we had to wait in a different line for alcohol so we went to the sevond line. The first girl in our group got carded. She handed her ID to the female bar tender. The bar tender would not reach out for her ID and stated 'I'm all the way over here' after she served my friend she moved the line to the other side of the bar. Making the five of us the last in line. When we got to the front for the second time I made a comment about the service to the owner. The response I got was "you are a smart ass" then the female stated "you are a buzz kill, why don't you get on a treadmill." This kind of behavior we experienced by a bar tender was extremely unprofessional. When the owner was confronted about the comments the bar tender made he attempted to make excuses for her behavior. The bar tender was recording us and attempted to call the cops because we were less than accepting of her unacceptable comments.
