The food was okay but way overpriced for what we got (service included). The staff seemed frazzled and all over the place. I ordered the cheesesteak, and it tasted overwhelmingly of mushrooms. I also asked for a bottle of water, and the water they gave was half frozen-- which wasn't helpful after a hot day with hours of walking. The condiments were empty and weren't refilled even through the time it took us to finish our food in its entirety, which was made worse by the fact that the empty bottles were repeatedly blown to the ground and just placed back up on the counter as if that weren't unsanitary. Don't think I'd return in the future.
