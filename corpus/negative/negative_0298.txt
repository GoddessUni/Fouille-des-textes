I am constantly dissappointed but my partner insists we have to keep coming back. 

First of all, it is way overpriced. You need to order everything separately (the burger doesnt come with fries) in order to get a whole meal, and it comes out to the same price as a much nicer place in Lambertville or New Hope. 

As for the food itself... The burgers are so much smaller than the bun, and the fries were hardly cooked. The sausage tasted like plastic, or turkey sausage, and was definitely a frozen patty. 

I wish I could come back but there are much nicer places to get breakfast and lunch in town.
