We came in to eat at the new local restaurant. Knowing this place has tons of seating, I was surprised there was no waitress service. Also, this was a Monday night and we were the only ones there. We were told to stand at the counter to make our selections and read the menu on the wall. Hardly a way to greet customers!  I had children with me and all ordered something different. There were nothing but teenagers running the counter and food prep and no one seemed to know what they were doing, what ingredients some dishes had in them and they all seemed completely clueless as to what they were supposed to be doing! This place just opened within the month, it left a pretty bleak impression. Lastly, the food lacked taste. Awful. I work at two jobs, directly located across and up the street from here. I could refer them alot of business if I had had a better experience. Needless to say, I wont be back.
