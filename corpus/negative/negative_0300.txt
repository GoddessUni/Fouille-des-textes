no no no no no... this is just not right! If you like Mexican food, don't eat here.

I will start with my review of the food, although I also had qualms with the service.

The chips and salsa gave me hope. The salsa was flavorful  and spicy and the chips were warm... then we got the guacamole. It was terrible. It tasted like cucumbers and was gross. I love guacamole with a passion and never leave any leftover... not so with this version. I barely ate any! I think they must use a guacamole seasoning mix...how sad!

Then our meals came out. The carne asada was thin, dry, flavorless, stringy and had a strange musty flavor. It came with rice, beans and guacamole. The beans were not bad, the rice was bland and I already told you about the guac.

We also got spinach enchiladas which were void of flavor, as well as cheese enchiladas, which again, were bland and blah. 

Now on to the service... NOT GOOD! We got there almost 10 min. after they had supposedly opened for the evening, only to find locked doors and no one in sight. A girl finally showed up and seemed annoyed that there were people waiting to be let in. She gave no apology that we had to wait or that she was late, just an irritated face. Throughout the meal, she just seemed bothered to be there, and bothered that we were there. I understand we have bad days, I've worked in customer service my whole life...but you can't make customers feel like a burden!

I would have given this place 2 stars if the service had been better, but the combo of the food AND service led to this 1 star rating. I won't be back!!
