We walked over on a saturday night after an event at The Sheldon.  We were told there is no service at the tables in front if the bar so I went to the bar to get drinks.  There is one bartender who is clearly in the weeds.  So instead of a cocktail I decide to get a couple of beers, they were out of the beer we wanted and while I was making a decision from the anemic selection the bartender yells out that its last call.  I'm like WHAT?  Its 11pm on a Saturday night, the bar is full and there are 3 people deep waiting for drinks and it's last call?  Wow!  Not impressed.  Also feel like if you're going to have last call at 11pm in a busy bar your name should NOT be The Grand TAVERN
