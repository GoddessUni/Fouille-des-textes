Last night we arrived in the bar section around 1 am. The atmosphere and people in it seemed kind and welcoming. Our problem was getting any service. As a bar employee myself I was upset. The owner would probably want to know the establishment only seems to cater to the regulars and utterly fails to all the curious out of town visitors. Waiting for 15 minutes when you're standing front and center, money in hand, at the bar is pretty bad... especially when the people flanking you are getting their drinks in under 5 minutes. Your peers can be tough critics. We know the way the job goes and we know the difference between being busy and blowing people off. We were there for an hour. We were served only once and the 1 round we were able to get wasn't even correct. I understand a busy karaoke night. When you have the same 5 singers over and over and a new person comes in wanting to sing you may want to share and not say, "we can't get you In til about 245." I know this because we spent almost a half an hour waiting for a round of shots and watched the same singers rotate. I would label this business as a club due to the fact that if you aren't a regular you won't get service.
