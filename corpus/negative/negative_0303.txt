I rarely review and wish I could say better things about a cute little non commercial place. For 3 days I searched the French quarter reviews for a croissant! You'd think their would be 300 bakeries but nope. 

Chocolate croissant was very flaky and light good. The bad very small nearly no chocolate. Much worse the $4.50 outrageous hot cocoa was a Luke cold cup of water and a dash of Hershey's syrup by taste. I asked for more chocolate and got the same cold liquid back with another squirt. Stick to cafe du monde.  I guess I just have to go either the other cattle while I was trying to find more unique. Also my wife's cranberry bar was inedible it was so sweet and granulated
