Hungry Howie's was our favorite pizza, but they seem to be going down hill. Our last two pizzas have arrived over 30 minutes late (I order through the app and request delivery at a specific time usually with at least 1.5 hours notice). With the most recent order I called to find out where my pizzas were and the girl on the phone sounded very annoyed that I was calling to find out where my pizzas were. She told me there was traffic and the driver was stuck and offered a very insincere sounding sorry. This was the same excuse I was given last time my pizzas were late so I quickly put their address into my GPS app and it didn't show any heavy traffic so I'm not sure what to make of this. When my pizzas arrived 40 minutes late they were barely room temperature. Unfortunately, I think  the combo of late, cold pizzas and lame customer service is enough to cause me move over to the competition.
