Good sandwiches at a reasonable price. I've been here three times for lunch during the work day since they opened. However, I'm giving two stars only due to concerns about the staffs consideration and attentiveness  towards customers and the music in the shop. 

Recently the music inside this establishment has been so loud that it's ruining "eat-in" experience. The music comes crashing down from the wall mounted speakers forcing diners to try and talk over it as it blares through the narrow corridor like seating area. Please consider adjusting the volume to a background level that compliments the atmosphere and decor instead of rocking-out to entertain the staff!

The staff should also be educated on how to approach routine tasks around customers who are eating. In one case I had employees trying to mop nearly under the table I was seated eating at with a bucket of smelly cleaning water inches from me! Please respect the dining experience.

In closing, the product sold here is spot-on but management really needs to catch these things before they turn-off any future business!!!
