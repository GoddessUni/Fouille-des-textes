Hate that this is my first ever review and that it's a bad one, but my experience at this restaurant was really disappointing. Chalk it up to new restaurant issues, perhaps... 

I ordered take out- $18 for a chopped salad with grilled chicken. It took 30 minutes for my order to come up (I believe they forgot my order). To their credit, they apologized and gave me a gift card for my troubles. However, the salad itself was super disappointing. It did not include all of the ingredients listed on the menu, had shredded chicken vs grilled, and had been overly dressed at the restaurant so it was soggy by the time I got home.

Anyway- I'm sad because I live in the neighborhood and was looking forward to having a local healthy-ish take out place to replace my uber eats addiction, but sadly this is not the one for me.
