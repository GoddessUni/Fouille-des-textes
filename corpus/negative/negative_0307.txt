Food took ONE hour to get to my table. I asked the manager where my food was and he said he'd check and never got back to me. I flag down the waitress and ask where the food is. 
(The waitress was sweet, not her fault at all!) Finally, I get my food. It's cold. I just want to get the hell out of there because I've been sitting there so long. We eat fast, go up to pay. I ask for a discount because I waited so long. Somehow my bill for JUST me was $18? 
I leave and then call the store a little later because I'm thinking it just isn't right. I wait on hold for TEN minutes for no one to even answer me. I go back in and complain and the manager was rude and said "You know I'm three servers down right? We're doing the best we can." and then said he couldn't do anything for me.
I'm angry. I didn't get a single apology and the manager was rude as hell and said there was nothing he could do for me. This Denny's is trash. I want my money back. Thanks.
I'd call and complain but you won't answer the phone :-)
