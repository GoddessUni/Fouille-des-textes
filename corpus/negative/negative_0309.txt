I would give zero if it was possible.  My step daughter ordered bone-in wings and they brought her boneless wings. We pointed out that her order was wrong and the waitress said that they would bring bone-in wings right away, but the she could nibble on the boneless ones until her correct order came. So, she started nibbling on the boneless ones and another waitress came up and ripped them out of her hands and said that she couldn't have them unless she planned on paying for them in addition to the bone-in wings.  So we waited for her wings to come and I tipped well - it wasn't our waiter who did this. We were turned off. 

We went back two weeks later and there was a sign on the door that they were having a company celebration and that they weren't seating after 7:30.  My husband arrived at 7:15 and they seated him. My daughters and I arrived at 7:20 and met my husband who was leaving (at 7:20). After seating him, a waitress asked him to leave saying that the kitchen was closed and they would not serve us. We went back in to see if the would reconsider because it still wasn't actually 7:30 and they wouldn't.  We aren't going back.
