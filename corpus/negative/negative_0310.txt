So we came here with the family on a recommendation only to be greeted by a rude hostess who chastised us for being 7 min late (we called and said we would be late and they said no issue). They tried to seat us outside in the heat and we asked to sit inside only to be told by the hostess that since we were late we had to wait over an hour to sit inside. Said we should have requested inside. Odd as 80% of their seating is inside, so why would we have to request inside?! FYI make sure you specify where you want to sit. 

The manager was completely unaccommodating and reiterated we had to wait for an hour. My wife, our three adult kids and I just decided to wait it out and go and enjoy ourselves at the bar. 

After being seated at our table we waited over 20 min to even get bread (now 1.5 hrs past our original reservation). Our waitress Lindsey was condescending and literally threw my salad plate on the table and ran off after I complained how long it took bring bread. She basically ignored us most of the meal (in the end over $400)! She asked at the end if I wanted to split our bill and I said "no this is my family" and her response was "Oh, you forgot to put name tags on each of your foreheads"! She topped it off, as I turned on my phone light to see the final bill by saying "yes, better check the bill for all the extra things I added on that you didn't order"! 

I typically do not go to this extent in a review but the service for what they charge is just horrible. Everyone has an off day but this was just over the top poor. Don't even bother going here no matter how good the food may be. So not worth the prices they charge.
