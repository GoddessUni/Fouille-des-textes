Rumfish is one of the mainstays for table service/breakfast in Terminal C, and we so wanted to think that our first...and second...experience (in a period of a few months) were exceptions.   That said, our last visit (May 25) sealed the deal: we are done with this extremely overpriced cafeteria.  Now, to the facts.

First: service is GLACIAL.  Expect to wait 5-10 minutes before a server comes by.   Each time we have been there, we've ordered coffee.  And each time, they bring it - inexplicably - without a spoon!  We've seen other tables also have to ask for a spoon.  Seriously.

So we ordered 2 eggs poached medium; first time we asked for bacon.  Each time, the eggs were nearly raw.  The bacon was barely warm - soggy & limp.  Toast was cold.   On our last visit (4 days ago) - we ordered the same thing but with sausage so as to avoid the limp bacon.   We waited 30 - yes 30 - minutes - whereupon the server told us the delay was because the poached eggs were not fully cooked.  So we waited another 10 minutes - and got...under-cooked (as in translucent whites) eggs.  Ridiculous.  I know how to poach an egg: it takes 5 minutes.  Period.   The entire meal lasted nearly an hour  - and what we got was egg soup; cold toast; at least the sausage was ok.  For $35.   Never, ever again will we be duped by this place.
