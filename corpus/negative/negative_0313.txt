Probably the worst experience I've ever had in the restaurant.  I went there with my grandson and wife, sat down right away, took 20 minutes to get a glass of water. We ordered and the food took another 20 million bytes or so to come. Food came, we had no utensils or napkins. I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich and tomato soup figured play it safe in a restaurant of that type.  It was awful,  the soup taste nothing like a tomato soup It  tasted like a bowl of starch. The grilled cheese sandwich was just like eating a greasy sponge. Truly inedible. My grandsons mac & cheese and hotdogs was cold and awful, even a 3 year old refused to eat it. My wife's club sandwich according to her was edible....... That doesn't say a lot. The young waitress was trying but was very inexperienced. Stay away from this place, opt for the good court, better good choices and the service will be better and probably cheaper.
