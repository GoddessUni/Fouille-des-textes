I can't figure out what everybody's raving about. I went there the other day and ordered three chicken strips. I added a side of sauce for $0.32. my total came to $4.54. I noticed the chicken was not greasy. I was surprised since most fried chicken is. I found the breading to be unseasoned and tasteless, as well as the chicken itself. I thought perhaps it was just the breast meat not having as much flavor as dark meat, but then I bit into my last tender, and it was total mush. I thought, some people will say this is tender, but I think this has been marinated, and way too long. Over marinating will break down meat and make it mushy. This does seem like food a child would enjoy. I have to say that was my first and last time eating at Cane's. I was so unimpressed with the mush and also a little put out that I had to pay for their weird sauce.
