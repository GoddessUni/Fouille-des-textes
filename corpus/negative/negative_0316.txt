I didn't expect the four seasons quality of food but the crap we got tonight I wouldn't even feed my dog.  It was literally mind blowing level bad.  We kept joking you'd have to make a literal effort to ruin all the food that badly.

Chili Tots:  Came out ice cold, mushy, and just like 6 strands of room temp cheese mixed into cold chili.  4 people at the table, no one would eat more than 1.

Chicken Jalapeño Avocado Sandwich:  No jalapeño.  No avocado.  No arugula.  Came out cold.  My friend took 3 bites and said she'd rather just starve through the concert we were going than take another bite.

Junior Burger:  ordered medium.  Burnt and so over cooked I had trouble chewing it.  Came on a bun 2x the size of the burger.  No burger sauce as promised from description.  Did manage to throw a single pickle on it in which isn't in the description.  Soggy cold fries on the side - also inedible.

Chicken Fingers:  Partially raw.  Inedible.

Cheesesteak Egg Rolls:  Room temp, soggy, 0/4 would eat more than 1 bite.

I am pretty sure a 5 year old could make a better plate of food than whatever it was you served us tonight and then charged us for.
