We had lunch here on Wednesday. Even though there were plenty of tables/booths, we were seated right next to the kitchen. We were in business casual so it's not like we looked like tourists you want to hide in some corner.

There appeared to be adequate waitstaff but service was extremely slow. The waiter was very slow to take our order. Once our order was taken, it was 40 minutes before any food was brought to the table. During that time, the waiter never came over to check on us or update us on the delay.

My entree did not even match the menu description. The menu described salmon on a bed of lemon butter angel hair pasta. What was brought out was salmon on angel hair pasta with a gloppy tasteless white sauce. My lunch companion had the skirt steak with fries. The fries were cold and the steak was slightly overcooked. Both entrees were barely warm which indicates they had been left sitting for some time.

My entree came with a dessert. The waiter plopped it on the table and did not even so much as ask my dining companion if he would like to see a dessert menu or ask if we'd like coffee with the dessert.
