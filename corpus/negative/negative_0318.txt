I've have to agree with some of the more recent reviews.  What happened?   We have been here a couple of times over the last two years and have walked away recently a little more disappointed each time.  We went here last week and were in and out in about 30 minutes.  The best I can say is that the pot of hot tea hit the spot.  The Mu Shu Pork was cold.  And except for the seafood side which was just okay, everything else was "something" chicken.  Honey chicken, orange chicken, etc.  The one beef dinner (beef and mushroom) didn't appeal to me at all.  I took some of the fried pork rice and the General Tso's Chicken and some of the Mu Shu Pork.  Somewhat blah...I found myself back up at the buffet area wandering and wandering around and couldn't decide on anything.  Went back to the table.  My wife was done with her plate.  We looked at each other and said, Let's go.  First off, General Tso's chicken should have me gulping down glasses and glasses of water.  Now, you've got my attention.  This was not even close.  They may want to add some kid slides and jungle gym areas and compete with Chuck E Cheese.
