Not so great.
Under seasoned if seasoned at all with too much sauce and beef that had to be a frozen puck. 

Today I was on a mission to taste test burgers and we made it to 7 burger joints. I think the only mistake we made was not having all the burgers outfitted the same. Small differences like house sauce vs mustard and ketchup and whole onions vs  grilled onions or no onions can adversely affect the taste. The thought was to order a cheeseburger from each place with nothing added or taken away just their signature burger. For that reason I am reviewing each burger as a stand alone and not head to head. Next time I think I will put them head to head with the same fixins.
