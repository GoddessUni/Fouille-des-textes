This place is a money grab and a scam of a restaurant. They are the highest priced place in the mall by far. The meal they give you is not worth even half the price they charge. I got one total fat no meat rib one small piece of chicken and a small amount of beef. It was the combo rip off. To put salt in my eye I ordered a cup it tap water and he charged me 50 cents for it without telling me. When I saw the bill I asked him and then he told me. The manager arrived and began to try to explain why they charge for water, I explained to her that all of the other places do not charge for tap water. If your going to be the highest priced place an charge for tap water your meal should be worth it. If you like grilled fat and high prices this is your place. I guess they think they are in Hawaii. No it's Reno, what's next you are going to charge for Hawaiian air too. You should be ashamed to be running a business like this. Where's McDonald's when you need them.
