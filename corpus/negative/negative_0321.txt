This is by far the worst experience at Pizza Hut that i've ever had. As a former employee of the brand, I know what day old crust looks like. We got our order and one pizza was completely wrong, all the crust was a day old or more, and the toppings were burnt trying to make up for the crust ( it doesn't looked cooked when a day old so they cook it longer). I called and ask them to replace the wrong pizza and told them about the crust. They sent me another that got here in half the time (weird ?)
Pizza was still old, the crust was not right and was made from a hand tossed with the outside cut off instead of it being a thin and looks like it rode a roller coaster. I LOVE pizza and couldn't eat it.
