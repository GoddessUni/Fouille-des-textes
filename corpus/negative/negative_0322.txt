We got a gift card so my wife and I thought we'd give it a shot.  We were seated promptly and then waited about 10 minutes for a waitress.  I ordered the riblet basket and my wife ordered the Thai chicken which came with salads.  20 minutes later we finally got our salads which were not bad.  A few minutes later we received our entrees before we finished our salads.  My riblets were adequate but the french fries were cold.  My wife's chicken was okay.  The portions were rather skimpy for the price. The waitress was not very attentive.  After we ate we waited another 10 minutes for our check.  All in all it was not a good experience so we will not be going back.  Sad, as it could have been an opportunity to gain 2 new customers.
