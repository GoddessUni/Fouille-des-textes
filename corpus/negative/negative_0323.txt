I was so excited to hear that Juniper had reopened! Unfortunately, this was probably the worst food I've had in Boise. I was sure they had a new chef but our server assured me they didn't. They still have almost all the same menu items that they did before closing. However, they "revamped" everything. 
I had the best mushroom risotto I'd ever had here last summer. I ordered the same thing tonight and it was the weirdest "risotto" I've ever had. I've never known a risotto to have tomatoes, peas and pesto. Yet it was bland. I had to add so much salt and pepper to make it somewhat edible. I was glad the server suggested I add salmon to it because otherwise I would still be hungry. I ate the over cooked salmon which wasn't terrible. Just dry. I ate more of the risotto than I normally would have because I hadn't eaten all day. 
My friend had the trout that she used to order and said it was also very different and flavorless. 
Our server said she would discount our check. I told her that wasn't necessary. That I just wanted to give feedback. She insisted. AND THEN.... came back and said that the manager wouldn't let her discount it because "nothing was wrong." 
I'm giving them two stars because our server did a great job but my friend and I both agreed that we wouldn't be coming back. Such a bummer.
