Wanted to believe this would be as enjoyable as everyone states, but when I arrived I was told that it would be a 20 minute wait. The time pass and I ask the hostess how's much longer she gave me an updated estimate of 1hr. Why she didn't tell me this from the beginning boggles my mind. From sitting at the bar I could see the decor is nice but nothing special. The wait staff were ok, but definitely not enough to support the volume and not attentive enough. The food was again nothing special and 1,000,000% NOT worth the wait or the price.
