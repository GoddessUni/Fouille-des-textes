It's your average CVS... walk in needing one thing, leave with 75 dollars worth of things you really don't need ...

However, the pharmacy is a nightmare.  every time.  These people are so inconsiderate and rude, I have trouble comprehending how they can keep a job.

Always, ALWAYS, act like they are doing you a favor answering any questions.  Never helpful, never friendly.  I try to go to Giant pharmacy when I need a prescription filled these days. 

Last time i dropped off a prescription and came back after 15 minutes  and took a seat.  right in front of them.  I waited, and waited....finally after 30 minutes of people coming and going I asked for a time frame.  It had been ready the whole time!  Liiiiiiike, do you think I just like sitting here in CVS for the heck of it?   Blood pressure rising.
