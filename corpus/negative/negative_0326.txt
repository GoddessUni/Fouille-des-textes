I have lived in Tucson for 58 years. We used to frequent Mama Louisa's when I was in elementary school- so at least 50 years ago. They had the best homemade spaghetti and fresh marinara sauce. It was consistent my whole life and we spent many birthday dinners eating homemade pasta! In the last several years, things have really changed. I keep going back hoping to get that fresh marinara that I always wanted to duplicate at home. But lately it has been thick, overly cooked, too salty and just not enjoyable. The homemade pasta was good, but I ordered Joe's special and the homemade pasta comes with it automatically. I ordered homemade pasta for my mom and it ended up a packaged fettuccini. The bread sticks were soggy. I'm not sure it we're hitting it on the wrong day and the sauce is reheated too much from the weekend or what. I may give it one more shot just to see if it's a fluke. If this is what were getting from now on, I won't be back after that.
