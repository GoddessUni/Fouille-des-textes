Seated immediate-party of 4 adults, 1child.  Took an hour for our entrees to be delivered to the table and they were delivered partially- it took an extra 10 minutes to get everyone's entree on the table at the same time while we waited for enough silverware, the tortillas that went with the Milanesa, and I never did get the ranchero sauce that was supposed to go on top of my burrito.  My fork was bent at such an angle it couldn't pick up food, my granddaughters lemonade was never refilled. Her order was supposed to be double rice, no beans- you guessed it: rice and beans.  I ate 1 bite of my burrito because it was so soggy from the fillings that had seeped out onto the plate-a pink juice -was that the ranchero sauce????? The fillings were cold, the guacamole salad was 1 tiny strip of an avacado on top of the burrito. Horrible service, horrible food.  The waiter kept telling us the manager would come talk to us.  Nope! Never.  We have gone here many times and it would usually rank a 3-4 star.  Not tonight-horrible service, horrible food, no visit from the manager, just sad.
