We were staying in the Rita Ranch area so we decided to get bbq to go from this place since it was on the way to where we were staying from downtown.  We called our order in and picked up our food (in the midst of a monsoon). We drove the 20 mins or so to our house before checking the bag, only to discover they had shorted us a kid's meal (which by the way consisted of 2 chicken tenders and a small order of fries for $7!).  Disappointed, we called the restaurant and they told us to come back and pick it up. We explained we were 20 mins away and it was pouring rain, could we please just be credited the amount since we'd paid by CC.  He said no, they weren't able to do that (seriously?) but next time we came in he'd give us a free meal.  We explained we were from out of town and he literally just said 'sorry.' Nothing else.  So while the food was tasty...it is also pricey and the customer service with how they handled the situation was a complete letdown.  The food was good, but we most likely won't return.
