Look, I will have to return to this place out of necessity - they get some good acts in here. But today was my first visit, just coming in to eat lunch, and somebody dropped the ball.

Our group of three entered through the door on the Walnut Street bridge just after noon, and some folks were at a table right inside the door, awaiting participants in some sort of convention. We walked toward the dining area to the left, and a member of that convention group said they'd rented out the whole room, and said we should go downstairs a level to find seating. So we walked down the stairs.

One level down, there were two kids in red Comcast shirts directing people into another room, who had no idea where we would find regular seating. Their feeling was that seating usually began with someone on the level we'd just come from. So we walked back up the stairs.

This time, we spoke to someone else from the convention group, who said the Comcast kids didn't know what they were talking about. We should go all the way to the bottom floor, he said. So we walked back down the stairs, past the Comcast kids, and down to a floor where we didn't even see tables for seating anymore. I stared down a few people who looked like they might possibly be able to help us, but each of them looked the other way. So we gave up, walked out the door and had an excellent lunch at Landmark on Market Street.

What a frustrating experience! I sure hope their concerts go a little smoother.
