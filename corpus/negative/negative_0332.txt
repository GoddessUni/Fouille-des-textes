Well, maybe you can't get good Italian food in Philly. Was hoping for this place. Pleasant interior, decent service, but, like most places, the pasta is overcooked. Had a scallop and linguini dish. Scallops were cooked twice as long as they should have. Pasta was mushy (and it was $27). Had the whole grilled bronzino as a second, which was fine, well grilled, but nothing amazing. 

I spend a lot of time in northern Italy and I just don't see why restaurants in the US can not seem to do this food well. They seem to universally do it poorly and charge 3 times what the amazing version of it costs in Italy.
