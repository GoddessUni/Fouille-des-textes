My friend and I went here for dinner tonight, we arrived and the hostess asked us if we were willing to sit at the bar, as there were many reservations for the night, we told her yes and were seated quickly at the bar. We each ordered a glass of wine and split a pizza. We finished our pizza and were still finishing up our wine, at this point our total time in the establishment was less than an hour, when the waiter approached us and told us there is a different bar (not attached to the restaurant), that he would recommend if we wanted to continue to talk and drink, and asked us to leave as there were other people waiting to be seated. This was unacceptable to ask any paying and tipping (20% tip) customer. I will not be returning nor recommending this restaurant to anyone.
