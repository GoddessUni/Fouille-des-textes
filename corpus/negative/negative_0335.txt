Jennifer G. has it right when she recomends sticking with the burger.  We ordered 4 entrees in all.  2 people got the burgers (and they were delicious) and reasonably priced for what you got.

However, I ordered the "braised rib" latke which was neither braised rib, nor latke (Linda Richman, anyone?).  I'm pretty sure it was chuck steak from a crock pot.  The latke was just mashed potatoes that were a little crispy on the outside.  Also, I got three tiny pieces of meat.  Fail!  

Another person at the table got the enchilada.  Again, not the best judgement call seeing this is the eastern seaboard of the U.S. The chicken was so dry, the problem was less their interpretation of Tex-Mex and more an inability to cook.

In summation, go and enjoy the GIGANTIC beer selection and stick with the burgers.
