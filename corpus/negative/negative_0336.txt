Horribly inconsistent. We drove an hour from Winter Haven JUST for Birria tacos. Second time coming here mind you. 1st the Birria tacos were soggy and barely any cheese. We had to send those back. Even the "fixed" order was still not as crispy as they should've been. 2nd I ordered a Tamarind... but an Orange soda showed up... 3rd, we ordered two drinks for the kids... those literally took a half hour to be delivered after us having to get up to request our drinks twice. The response ? "Oh they've been doing this all day". Well then they shouldn't be employed because the suck ass! THEN the chick doesn't even know what the drinks are... How hard is it to write down a damn drink order??? And wtf can't you just hand us the damn drink while weee standing there?!? Ugh... it was fantastic the first time we came and I think that's because the owner or manager was there; grayish haired white guy. But this visit was ruinous.
