I was really looking forward to dining here, but I was disappointed in so many ways. 
I was with a party of 12 celebrating a birthday, and the food was really subpar, except for the calamari and the blue cheese sourdough bread. The calamari was awesome, the sauces complimented it amazingly well. Also the blue cheese topped sourdough was surprisingly good as well. Now for my entree, I ordered the lobster linguine and wanted to have some spinach tossed in the pasta, but had to settle for a side of creamed spinach. And the guy beside me ordered an 8oz filet and an order of mashed potatoes. My pasta was so bland that I had to ad salt and pepper to have any type of flavor. The lobster meat was tough and rubbery, like it was frozen not fresh at all. And my creamed spinach didn't come out until I was about done with my entree. The guy beside me ordered an 8oz filet that came out looking like a 4 oz chunk. As a chef myself I know there will always be some shrinkage, especially when ordered MW or higher but not half the weight. The maître d' took the steak back after trying to convince my guy that it was because of the shrinkage. The maître d offered my guy a 10oz filet for the price of the 8 to make up for the small cut, and that was a great gesture until it came out at the end of our visit and it was actually a flat iron instead of the filet that he ordered.
Lastly we had a person arrive to dinner extremely late and wanted to order a drink, and the server would not serve her because he said our party was over by 35 or 45 minutes. I have never heard of such. Our party collectively spent about $1200-$1500 for dinner and was given the cold shoulder because they said an hour and a half is all we are allowed for dinner service.  So, even though I enjoyed the company of family and friends, we definitely did not enjoy our food or service at all!
