Went for supper. Was a bit confused as to whether it was table service or not. Just took a long time to get a server to come over so...maybe maybe not? Got the nachos to start, meat was awesomely cooked but I found the sauce not to my taste. It's very molasses heavy flavor and less smoky. Same with the pulled pork sandwich, yummy meat (same meat) but that sauce ruined it for me and the coleslaw made the bun incredibly soggy. Fries were yummy and well seasoned but we didn't eat much of the food and left to go get a meal after.  Kind of a bit expensive too . $43.00 for nacho starter and two sandwiches with 2 cans of Coke. Just because I don't like the sauce and they use it for almost everything I won't be back.
