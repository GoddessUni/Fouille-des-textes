I've lived here 2 years and I'd been wanting to try this place. Some friends and I walked in around 3pm on a Saturday to a fairly empty restaurant, were told we could sit anywhere, then after several minutes with the menus the waitress comes over to take drink orders - we each order a mimosa. Then we ask for another moment to look at the menus for food and the waitress snapped and said the kitchen was closing and she didn't feel like making drinks while we took our time with the menus. We were a very confused and I double checked the hours online and it said open until 10pm. She then came back over and yanked our menus away and said "sorry the kitchen is closed" in an extremely rude tone. 

Maybe this was true, but the way it was handled was extremely rude. The waitress could have mentioned this the moment we walked in. Unless someone drags me back I don't plan on giving this place another try - the staff came off very hostile and even followed us out eyeing us as we left as if we were the rude ones... Not my idea of southern hospitality.
