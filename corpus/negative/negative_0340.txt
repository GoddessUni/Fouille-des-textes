This is the 4 hard rock I've been to and this one is highly disappointing.

My boyfriend, roommate and I came here for my birthday. It was rather small compared to any of the other ones I've been to. I had the wild berry smoothie which was great, our friend had the hippie punch and it was great. To die for. 

We ordered the nachos for an appetizer and my boyfriend had a Caesar salad. The salad was great. I wished they had more croutons, but no complaints besides that. The nachos themselves were bland, didn't come with much on them, but those that had toppings were delicious. 

Our entrees were such a let down. I had the salmon, it tasted like it came out of the freezer. The mashed potatoes were great, I ordered onion rings with it and they were soaked in grease. Literally soggy. My boyfriend asked for a burger cooked medium, it came out like a hockey puck. It had Swiss and mushrooms which wasn't bad. Just overcooked. Our friend had the fiesta burger and hers was undercooked, but other than that she loved it. 

The waitress was great and the overall atmosphere is lively and friendly. I wish the food was better because this place would be perfect.
