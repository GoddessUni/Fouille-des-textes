I dined here recently with a group of friends for dinner. I ordered the Pumpkin Agnolotti (a ravioli-type dish). The menu said it was $16, which seemed reasonable for pasta, although less reasonable when I was presented with a portion sized for a baby bird (strike 1). I could have overlooked the size if I had been presented with something truly spectacular that wowed my taste buds. Unfortunately, the pasta was drowned in a thick cream sauce that completely overpowered what was supposed to be a pumpkin filling (strike 2). For all I know, there wasn't even pumpkin in there. It's sad to say but I've had better pasta at some chain restaurants. Still that too could have been overlooked because I was having such a nice time with my friends. You win some, you lose some. Until I received the check and saw I was charged $32 for the dish (strike 3). It says nowhere on the menu that the price shown is for an appetizer. However, apparently everything in the PASTA section is priced for the appetizer portion. While our server was friendly and attentive, I deducted his tip severely (something I vary rarely do) for completely failing to mention that the entr√©e size of pasta was $32. 

The best part is that before posting this review, I decided to check out other reviews and see what people were saying (normally I would have done this prior to selecting a restaurant but I didn't select this place). In response to one unhappy yelper, the owner commented, "We also charge what the menu says things cost." Nope. Not so much.

2-24 Update: I just reviewed my credit card statement and it appears that the someone adjusted the tip amount and charged me more than I had authorized. Disputing with my credit card company. Would NEVER recommend this place.
