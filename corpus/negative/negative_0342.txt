It's such a shame that the food isn't good. (we've tried them twice now) The location is great and the staff and delivery people and kind and quick. We've ordered: sesame chicken, sweet and sour chicken, general tso's chicken, and shrimp with vegetables; sides were: chow mein, white and fried rice.  Of all the items, the sweet and sour was the best, but it was only standard when compared to other restaurants.  The fried rice reminded me of rice-a-roni at best.  I really hope that we've just gotten the new cook each time. On the plus side our small children enjoyed the mild tastes.
