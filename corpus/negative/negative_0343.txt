We generally have a great experience but this one was lacking. Despite the wait time being almost doubled the rest of the experience didn't improve.  It seemed as if our server could only do one thing at a time. I asked for a drink menu and after asking again it still did not arrive. I ended up going to the bar and purchased a drink there. I had to actually purchase it because the bar staff said they did not know who my server was.  My server never apologized for not getting the menu and never offered a refill. The food was good but probably would have been better as a carry out. When the small pizza arrived she handed it instead of putting it on the table holder which resulted in it falling on the table. The server offered to get another pizza made but again no offer of sorry or assistance. We were not about to wait even longer.
