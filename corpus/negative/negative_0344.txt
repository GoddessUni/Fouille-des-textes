I'm not sure what experience the cooks need in order to get a job here but making 2 eggs over easy, 2 slices of bacon and a couple of potatoes is so basic, my 8 year old niece can do it. I was served 2 overcooked sunny side up eggs, drowning in butter/oil on the plate. The bacon was so dry and cold, I didn't even bother, and the potatoes were cold. Overpriced garbage. 

Came back a week later and sat upstairs, asked for ketchup, never got it. Nobody came to take our order until I walked up to the bar. The place was empty. 

If you want to consistently get ripped off for having a shit time, definitely check this place out. 

4 floors of absolute fuckery. It's 2017, get your shit together, people.
