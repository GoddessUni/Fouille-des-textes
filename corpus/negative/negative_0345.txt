Went here for dinner on a recommendation from staff member at our hotel, Bourbon Orleans (across street). We sat at the bar and had dinner, we were served by Elle (I believe?) 
We asked for two glasses of rose and she said do you want a bottle? I replied no we are looking for by the glass, and she said would you like a taste? Which I replied, yes please. We are given a taste, then she brings us the bottle (sigh).  We ordered the arugula salad and bbq shrimp and grits.  The salad must have sat in the window for 15 minutes.  Elle had disappeared for 15-20 minutes and all the staff was too busy watching the football game to bring the salad. We finally received our food, which tasted ok, the only good part of the meal.
At the end of our meal, Elle told us she had just come back from vacation and was very tired and not moving very fast today. It was strange, we will not be going back here.
