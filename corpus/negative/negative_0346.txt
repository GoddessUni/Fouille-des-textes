Is the food good at Urban Grub?  I wouldn't know.  My wife and I stopped in at 4 pm on Saturday.  People were eating in an open window area, and the place looked inviting.  A very nice and courteous young lady at the reception desk told us, after we asked for a table for two, that the dining room didn't open until 5pm, but that we could order from the menu at the bar.  We proceeded to the bar and sat at a table in the adjacent patio, where a number of other patrons were enjoying drinks and where there was an equal number of additional, vacant tables.  After being ignored for  10 -15 minutes, I asked for a menu, only to be told by an older woman,  who was stocking place settings, that we were sitting at a "reserved" table, that the restaurant was fully booked for the night, and that we couldn't be served.  We apologized and left the restaurant.
I later looked at the Urban Grub web page to see what we had missed, and was quite surprised to see that it says that dining on Saturday is from "11 am to 11 pm."  Apparently, not every Saturday.  Or at least not this Saturday.
Is the food good at Urban Grub?  I will never know, as I never plan to visit the establishment again.
