My husband and I were excited to try B.D.  based on the recommendation of a 'foodie' friend.  Well, the experience was not what we had hoped it would be.

We knew you could bring your own wine, but did not know about the B.Y.O.G. policy.  The waitress had us go to Sullivans, then the Shell gas station to find glasses.  With no luck, we ducked into The Empty Vase and they were very helpful in selling us some glasses.  So we settled in for what we hoped would be a great evening...

Most of the menu offered heavy food options, so we ordered a salad and thought we would try the Jeff burger.  After our order, our waitress ran out crying and the manager and/or owner stood at the next table complaining about her.  Meanwhile our food finally arrived, but we never saw the staff again to check on us or refill our water. 

The food was okay, pretty average, but the management was so unprofessional that it was a major turn off.  The food was certainly NOT worth the strange vibe and lack luster service.
