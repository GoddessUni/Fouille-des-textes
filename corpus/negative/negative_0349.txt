So...  have been going to Hellas for over 10 years.  Used to love this place as it used to be on par with Greek islands, Parthenon etc. in Chicago as that is where I am from.  Unfortunately, something changed since we were there in April.  The portions accross the board are noticeably smaller.  The Greek salad used to be served on a large glass platter, now it is served only on a large white serving plate approx 1/2 the size.  One of my daughters had the scallops and the other had the broiled octopus.  Both of which were a little more than half the serving size we had before.  I ordered the leg of lamb and not to mention a small serving size it was as tough as beef jerky.  We have spent over two thousand dollars a year at this restaurant every year and will never go back again.  So disappointing as we used to look forward to this meal every time we visit family in the area.  I am writing this while having a turkey sandwich as I am still hungry from not being able to eat the "lamb" that I had ordered.
