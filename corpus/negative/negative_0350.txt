Three of us visited TaTa for lunch recently, and the experience was mixed.  We really wanted to like the place because it seems like a welcome change from the normal Indy fare, but there were too many misses to be ignored.  The Cuban sandwich was OK.  Nothing was hand cut, and it seemed sort of slapped together with the same ingredients you could get at Kroger.  The Pernil Gurnatnamero was not as good.  The pork was a block of meat that looked like it had been cut in some food factory.  I can't believe a human would cut meat that way.  Part of it was reasonably moist and tender, but most of it was dry and tough.  The Arroz Amarillo Cienfuego was a bit better, but here too the meat was dry and overcooked.  I'm hoping I caught them on a bad day.
