One star. For the company. The service was terrible. Over 1 hour for our food. We were a party of 9. It is a Saturday night. There is play off football on tv. Everyone had their food except for the guy that ordered a Zep. We had to wait an additional 10 min for that . We asked to speak to the manager. 
He came to our table and was very annoyed when he got here. He never acknowledged the fact that we waited. He was very defensive . Said... It's Saturday night and there's a football game on. Yes sir. It's a "sports bar!" Really.... 60 + min for bar food? 
He took 25.00 off the check and our waitress was no where to be found. We didn't need anything off the check. Just an acknowledgment of the time we waited. Maybe an apology. 
Won't be back for a long time. 
The food was so so. 
The service was bad. 
The company was great.
If you come here... Bring nice friends!
