Meh foods and drinks. Rare to find a Vietnamese restaurant with a bar but I was left disappointed. The only reason why I didn't give 1 star is because of the ambiance. They got the drawing right on the wall that brings me back to Vietnam. 

We got 2 drinks and asked for less sweet and both of them were so sweet I had to send mine back. It came out tasting the same. Super slow service, took 20 mins to get our drinks and the bar tender was busy chit chatting with the only customer at the bar. 

Foods order: summer rolls, pork belly Bao bun, Hanoi chicken pho, and Saigon beef pho. Summer rolls was mere laziness with no sliced pork belly but they used Vietnamese ham. All the broth was so sweet that I felt like sugar was on sale or something, even the northern dishes labeling Hanoi which should not have sugar in it also were so sweet. 

Will not come back.
