Is there a fraction of a star option? A friend of mine who bags groceries at Fry's couldn't stop raving about Ra sushi, so I decided to take my wife and two kids for an early dinner. I was greeted by a friendly young woman who sat us at a comfortable and elegant booth. The menu looked tantalizing. We ordered a plethora of rolls and appetizers. Then the manager approached us and this is where things took a dark turn. First off, I don't want to say that he had teeth like The Penguin in Batman 2... but he had teeth like The Penguin in Batman 2. Maybe that's why he works at a sushi bar? Idk. He asks us how things are, paying a strange amount of attention to my wife, who is wearing a slightly revealing dress. I kindly remind him that our eyes are up here, to which he violently suggests that I am out of line. There are children present mind you. I tell him he reeks of cheap alcohol and spoiled fish. Our server had to collect his piss drunk pencil d*ck boss and make sure everything was resolved. Sad!
