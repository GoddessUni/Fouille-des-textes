I ate at Jazz a week ago, and was pleasantly surprised. I haven't ever been to New Orleans, but this place will give you the essence of being there in a Disney Land type of way. It was clean, and still had the new car smell. I give new restaurants a lot of lee way for service and food quality, but the day we showed up everything was fine. 

We ordered the chicken wings ($.50 each on Wednesdays), and considering myself a connoisseur of chicken wings, I was very happy with them! You can ask them to make them extra spicy, which is a good idea, as the regular are kinda wimpy. 

I wasn't in love with my entree, the Louisiana shrimp; it was too saucy with out a lot of substance. My rating was based on the skill of the deep fryer; he did an amazing job on everything that was deep fried. 

The wings, crawfish, catfish, shrimp and oysters were all cooked to perfection! Crisp and light, while still succulent on the inside. Keep that guy around Jazz! Be warned, with all new restaurants quality will vary as the chefs learn their stations... 

Long story short 3 out of 4 entrees were great, the appetizers during happy hour were $4.99 and worth every penny, the wings were fantastic and a great price at $.50 each on Wednesdays... and the place was clean with a decent staff. At my age with a 20 month old daughter I prefer the Disney Land Experience to the Bourbon Street experience, but your taste may vary (sorry no flashing from coeds while I was there)! 

The downers were my entree (the Louisiana Shrimp) and the bread you get when you arrive (big time blah).
