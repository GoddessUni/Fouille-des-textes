I was really disappointed in the detail of the service.  I paid for the most expensive package + tip just before you start getting into detailing.  There were a number of spots missed on my exterior including the doors handles, wheel wells, along the cap of the bed, the hood, the roof, and contours along the rear and sides among others.  I've spend more time wiping it down myself than I did waiting for it to be done.  It felt like a rushed job and it shows.  I don't mind paying for a job well done but this was just an expensive waste of time.
