I go to Tien Tuyen for lunch fairly often, and have had a wide range of experiences there.

Usually it's decent. Clean (albeit plain) interior, reasonably friendly staff, good food, reasonable prices (except for the iced coffee - good, but not worth the high price here) and we can be in and out for lunch within an hour. This has kept me going back for a long time!

I had one experience, however, which sort of ruined this place for me. A coworker and I walked in just after noon, a little later than we usually get there. The front area of the restaurant was fairly full, but that's not unusual. We waited about 5 minutes to be seated, then were ignored for about 15 minutes despite knowing what we wanted moments after opening our menus. When our waitress finally showed up, we ordered our drinks and meals, which we've had before - they usually come fairly quickly. 

Our glasses of water showed up 15 minutes later. They were warm and mine had some bits floating in it. About 30-45 minutes after ordering (an unusually long time for this place), our food showed up. My coworker's sauce had a dead fly floating in it. 

By this time we were already going over our lunch hour, so we ate as fast as we could and went up to the counter to pay. As we waited at the counter, our waitress was hovering around, not doing much, but took a few minutes to chat with someone before asking if we were wanting to pay, then directed us to another woman at the counter to actually pay. 

We left an appropriate tip and left. We probably will not go back.
