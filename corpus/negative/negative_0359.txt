I understand times are rough right now and nobody wants to be working so late on a Sunday. My parents came in from out of town so we were directed to go here because of their 24hr service. The service was extremely slow and it lacked basic restaurant expectations. It took over an hour and a half to get our food and when we did get our food it was not complete.  The last thing we got was a salad that we ordered specifically with no blue cheese and it was covered all over with it. By the time we got our food we were more tired than hungry. Most likely will not come back!
