I am sitting in this terrible excuse for a restaurant, managed by a manager who doesn't give a crap waiting for my overpriced bill after the marathon/ ordeal that was one of my worst dining experiences of my life.  The TWO HOUR fiasco was marked by non-existent service, food that was almost cold and a manager-when he finally had nothing better to do than eventually come around fifteen minutes after requested-who displayed an attitude that does not indicate any interest whatsoever in pleasing his customers.  It took almost 40 minutes to get bread, another 30 minutes to get our salads and another FORTY-FIVE minutes to get the now-cold main course.  The waiter never checked on us after delivering the main course and it even took another TWENTY MINUTES to get our stinking overpriced bill after we were ready to go.  TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE.  Ari Viderci.  Never again.
