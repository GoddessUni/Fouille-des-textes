Rolled up to the bar with 15 minutes before my flight. No one waiting & the waitress refused to pour a glass of wine cuz it wasn't the right glass.' She said Your gonna have to wait until the 'right' glasses get to the bar, that way I know how much to pour.' 
When asking her if I could give some constructive feedback to her manager about keeping a measuring device behind the bar to increase sales, her reply was, 'I'm not the owner I don't make the rules, but if I was.. The wine would be free and I'd be pouring it down your throats.'  
   I understand that people in airports can be in a rush. But if you chose to serve the public being sarcastic and rude to customers is no way to represent yourself or  the company you work for. Needless  to say
I will not be returning.
