Worst Hob venue ever , they should be ashamed of themselves , especially considering its the staple venue and in NOLO home of Isaac Tigret! Anyway it was Friday nights around 8ish we had to stop by I opened the Dallas Venue so I know what to expect 1. Very Empty 2. Tables were all moving scared for them to break 3. So we sit at bar just me nf my daughter ( the bartender acted so upset the he had to help us , as if he was doing anything else so NOT POLITE ) so basically what you want attitude! 4. Brought my daughter food 8 minutes before mine, (we ordered kids grilled cheese and tomato flatbread)easiest food in menu! 5. They must have forgot my pizza was in back so brought to me COLD and undone!!!!! I say I need a warm pizza then another 15 minutes before they bring no manager actually I had to go to bar because bartender,nobody came to check and see how we were doing or if we needed anything I walked to bar 3 times about the pizza, then the manager with no class or managment skills comes to table and says was there a problem after they walked around with my pizza in their hands for over 5 mintues and then trys to charge me for it. so then I say keep the pizza, then copes an attitude and says ok well ill take it off you can eat it if you want too... just rude and not acceptable for HOB venue, I just wanted to run out!!! WOW SUCH BAD... for the first time EVER!!! I left without leaving a tip EVER... I eat out very often...... and this was soooooooo bad....
