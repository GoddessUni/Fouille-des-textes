Sadly, I've been a customer here for quite some time but after about a dozen sub par experiences, I have to write off Bonfire. While their food is quite good, the service has become atrocious, the plates, silverware and restrooms disgusting and the staff oblivious, I can only assume the kitchen is likewise poorly maintained. The plates and silverware often have to be exchanged for those without crusted food on them, lipstick on the glasses, or food clogged in the forks. Once or twice I could understand, but this has become the norm despite us leaving upward of 25% gratuity during each visit. I've noted my concerns to our waitstaff on several occasions, but they never seem to be too concerned.
