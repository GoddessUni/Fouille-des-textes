Commanders Palace. Hiding behind a name. 

In a word, uneventful.  I consider myself quite the foodie,  including a Michelin star restaurant visit every now and again.  This place is capitalizing on the name and cache.  The appetizer we decided on was the Mardi Foie.  A trio of foie gras preparations.  Pan seared foie gras, can't go wrong with that, it makes me happy just like bacon.  Two beignets filled with foie gras infused cream cheese, very nice, shaped more like a doughnut hole but the crispy outside contrasting the gooey cream cheese was the highlight, very difficult to pick up and flavors of foie gras.  The final in the trio was foie gras infused root beer.  The delicate flavor of the foie gras was overpowered by the root beer, couldn't even tell it was anything but a shot of root beer.  For the main course we settled on the duck breast.  The waiter made this big deal as if the duck was prepared in some type of a salt cure before roasting to crisp the skin.  I call BS.  Anything salted (have made Confit of duck and duck prosciutto) changes in texture and flavor.  This duck was tough, stringy, barely seasoned if at all, over a bed of "stuffing" made with sundried tomatoes, not a pleasant combination.  OH! And some kind of weird cranberry stuff like a remoulade but not, it was bitter to the point of unpleasant.  The root vegetables were clearly steamed or boiled and lacked any seasoning.  And when did cauliflower become a root vegetable?  Would it have killed them to put them in a roasting pan with some bacon fat, after all it was a 9 dollar side, how about a little effort.  At $175 per person with drinks, tip, tax and the turtle soup which could have been anything soup, my strong recommendation is go to one of the many other truly wonderful restaurants in New Orleans.
