Just my luck to stumble upon Fuel the same week as the Inky does a big article about this trend in its Thursday food section. Healthier food, lower calorie counts are big these days according to the Inky. And with the big 500 CALORIES or less sign, that's what right where they are.

It's a colorful place. Nice lay out although the bench we not comfortable when you leaned back (pillows would help give back support). There was a distinct Oder in the place and not necessarily a good one. Reminded me of fish but maybe some healthy food stinks. 

You head to counter, give your order and wait at your table for food to be delivered. 

Had Tomatoe soup (less than 200 calories) and Cesar salad with shrimp and dressing on side. Bottle of water.  

Price was 18 dollars! That moved  them quickly into the BETTER DELIVER FOR THAT AMOUT OF MONEY category FAST. 

Didn't take long to arrive. Nice server delivered it (same person who took my order). 

Soup was fair. Not much taste. Shrimp was not impressive. Warm in temperature as if it didn't come right off grill. Greens were ok. I wasn't impressed in any way. 

Doubt I'll return.

(Got response from restaurant about a lunch special half the price of what I paid that I was never told about or offered. MAJOR FAIL!!!)
