If I could give this place a negative 1 I would have. I use to love this place like a year ago, they use to be great when the kid that loved spongebob was always there. Anyways went there today and had to repeat my order like 3 times. When I got to the window I could hear the worker ( her name was Mia for future reference) talking about me saying I was rude and insulting me. Perhaps if the employee could have understood me  maybe the second timeout that would have been great. So she slams the window open and gives me attitude so I ask for the manager and I tell him what happened and she proceeds to say well I was multitasking while talking over me when I was trying to tell the manager what happened. If you are busy doing something why not just say hey can you hold for a minute. I told the manager I didn't want my food in fear they would do something to it and that was that. While the employee was still insulting me. I'll probably never go here again.
