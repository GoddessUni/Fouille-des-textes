Came here after seeing the reviews, maybe with too high expectations. I noticed it was in a strip mall and I thought "oh?" Walk in and we are standing awkwardly in the doorway right by people eating. Didn't know what to do so we sat down at the only spot available. (Right by the door of course, nothing like blazing hot air in your face every time the door opens as you eat hot chicken) anyway The fried chicken was good, huge. But the green beans was about 4 bites worth and they were like canned green beans and same with the black eyed peas. The side portions were also so small. It took SO long to get our food. My beer had chicken batter stuck to it which was replaced but made me question why raw batter was so close to an open container of beer. It was packed in there and we were all on top of each other. Service was friendly but not very attentive   Atmosphere was lacking big time which was the deal breaker for me, I felt like I was in a weird chow hall. Fried chicken was good but for over $100, crappy atmosphere and lacking sides, etc we won't be back unfortunately.
