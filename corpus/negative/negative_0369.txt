I ordered on Uber Eats. They cancelled the order. I called and asked why. Lady said they didn't serve what I ordered on Thursday. I asked why I was able to select it on Uber Eats. She said "yes, you're able to select it". I told her she needs to update the Uber App so they are not listing items that aren't available. She said "don't tell me what to do". I asked for her manager. She said she was the Manager. I asked for the owner, she said she was the owner, and she hung up on me. Am I asking too much for a menu to reflect what is actually available? They could have called. I would have picked something else instead of waiting for an hour only to find out I'm not getting my food. Very rude business.
