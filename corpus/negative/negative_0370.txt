If you are looking for hotels in this area on Priceline, this is what you will get stuck with unless you spend big bucks. DO NOT STAY HERE. 

Old. Rundown. Stinky. Dirty. Stains everywhere. Mold in all the bathrooms. I didn't shower in my 1 night stay here, that's how disgusting I found the bathroom.

They have these signs all over the place that say "Satisfaction guaranteed or get 100% refund," ya, bullshit. When I had a nuclear meltdown at the front desk over the shit hole of a room they put me in, they moved me to a "suite" which was pretty much the same bullshit. A tad larger, a bigger couch and the same disgusting stained everything. They would NOT refund me my fucking money. I was SO pissed. I basically made it clear to EVERYONE in that hotel what a fucking dump this place was.

Also, it's a long haul from downtown Philly, much further than the Priceline map/area suggested it was. Had I known it was this far I would have just booked directly in downtown Philly.

God, this place is seriously gross. Someone please tear down this establishment already.
