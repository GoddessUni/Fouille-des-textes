I warned that the portions were huge so it would be best to share. My wife and I split a spinach salad, fried prawns and barbecue rib appetizers. 

Perhaps they've changed their portion sizes because the salad was a normal sized one and there were 3 shrimp and 3 ribs. 

Salad was good. Shrimp were decent. The ribs, however, had a greyish look as if they'd been boiled or steamed, rather than grilled. They were served with a red potato salad with green goo in it. It was terrible. 

My drink was flat, which is something the bartender should have noticed. 

Overall, this seems to be just another trendy chain, no different than Applebees, Chilis, or any other chain.  If you like those, you might love this place. 

If not, don't bother.
