This restaurant has a good vibe, nice servers, and is earnest in its approach. However, it doesn't come close to a genuine SW Texmex or New Mexican restaurant. The green chili is far too mild to satisfy the palates of folks who know. The red chili is better, but still falls short of the savory sauce you'd get in a non-chain restaurant in Albuquerque or El Paso.  This is really just average Mexican food - not bad but not that good either. 

The salsa is very good though as is the beer selection (though my bottle was served without a glass!!!).
