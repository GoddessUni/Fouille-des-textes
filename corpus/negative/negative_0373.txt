My first time eating there was not so good. My friend ordered a crawfish pasta dish, and it was very spicy. She ask the manager could she have something less spicy, he said most of the food there is spicy. He offered to take it back, and prepare it with less pepper. When the saver brought it back to the table, the portion was smaller, and it was still spicy. The manager was called to our table, my friend made the same complaint about this plate. I asked him, if we are expected to pay for this, he said yes. He then give us a lecture on how to order food at a restaurant. He said we should tell the saver, make sure our food isn't spicy. I know the name of this please is fire food, which is a metaphor for hot food as in temperature or spicy. Please use the words spicy, pepper, kill your taste buds and make your nose run food. Please put more napkins on the table, your customers will need them to wipe their noses !
