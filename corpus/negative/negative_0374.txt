We last ate at Duling-Kurtz 30 years ago.  It was our special occasion place to go.  We then moved out of the area.  We now have returned . This past week we had another special occasion and decided to eat at Duling-Kurtz.  We were very disappointed.  The meal was mediocre to say the least.  The French onion soup was very good, dinner rolls w/lemon curd very good.  The meal went downhill from there.   The salad was nondescript.  No shaved cheese or anchovy filet  in the presentation .  We had the house specialty lobster crepe.  The crepe and the lobster filling was dry and the vegetables were over cooked.  We did not have dessert.  Regarding the atmosphere in the room that we ate, the interior needed a do over and seemed to not have been painted since we were last there 30 yrs ago.  We were not rushed through the meal but the waitress that we had was inattentive.  Finally, the meal was extremely expensive.  I don't mind paying for an extraordinary meal, but this meal was one step above diner food.  This will be the last time that we dine there.  So disappointed.
