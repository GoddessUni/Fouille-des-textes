My husband and I have date night every Friday night and always started off the date with a visit to Ric's grill.  Up to about a month ago the service, food and atmosphere have been awesome.  We always order the same meals;large Caesar salad and crab stuffed mushroom caps for my husband and a large salad with halibut for me.  Our last meal there was March 07/14. We sat in the lounge as is per our usual and were greeted right away.  We ordered our usual and waited for the bread to arrive.  After 10 minutes I had to ask the hostess for bread.  When our waitress saw the bread on our table she never said a word, just took the empty basket away.  My husbands items came first but he did not get crab stuffed mushroom caps, instead it looked like some sort of spread on crackers.  When he asked our waitress if the kitchen had run out of mushrooms she said they were "mixing it up" with a mushroom pate instead and left.  My husband was not impressed.  My salad and halibut came....my halibut was dry, tasteless and had a thick brown crust and my salad was bitter with almost no dressing.  The waitress came back about 15 minutes later to ask how our meals were.  I told her to take mine away as I wouldn't be eating it.  She said,  "oh I knew it wouldn't taste right when I noticed the Halibut was over cooked"  What???? Then why would you bring it to me???  They did not charge me for the meal but the damage was done none the less.  We will not be going back.  Shame
