I'm sure this place is fine on a normal night, but honestly, special events are not their strong suit. First off, the location on Mass Ave that closed, a few years ago, had a Seinfeld trivia night and they posted the wrong address on facebook. I messaged them to let them know and it was never fixed, so my husband and I were literally the only two people who showed up. The food at that location wasn't good and I watched the guy make my mac and cheese, by nuking a block of velveeta in the microwave and then charging me $13 for it. Over the weekend we went to see Santa and the Grinch. Granted, this was the only free event in town with a Grinch (other places were charging $20 per person including kids for breakfast with the Grinch). Well you get what you pay for. It was smart that they asked people to register in advance and get tickets, but I think booking a certain time window would've been a smarter decision. The place was way too crowded, no one wearing a mask except staff (which is scary because very little kids still aren't able to get the vaccine). There was no one to take photos so if you wanted a family photo with Santa or the Grinch you had to ask a stranger to take it and hope it looked ok. There was someone working the door, but no one actually controlling the line for Santa and the Grinch. Once the Grinch arrived (he was ten minutes late) It got incredibly busy. My best advice is next year, ask people to book a specific time to avoid it getting so crowded, and have one staff member taking photos, and one other controlling the line. I'd also suggest making it a requirement to have some kind of donation to a charity. They were doing a toys for tots drive, but the info was emailed out after I registered. The box was empty when I arrived. The flow to enter and exit was also a bit of a disaster.
