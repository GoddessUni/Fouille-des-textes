We had a reservation and were looking forward to eating here. When we arrived they were setting up for a large party. We kept waiting, and I asked if we could be seated at a table a few feet away--in fact as it turned out by the time they moved all the other tables to create seating for the large party, it was the only one remaining. But the man setting it up literally barked at me saying , "I don't know!" He also curtly  gestured at their set up, scolding me--this is the only space we have. Earlier when I approached him he has also said rudely we will seat  you don't worry. My husband and I felt so unwelcome that we left. And we aren't going back
