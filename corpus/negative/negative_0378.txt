DONT COME TO THIS PLACE!!

The bartender and the kitchen staff in this place is horribleeeee. There is a bartender lady who is half Shaved her hair took me and my coworker's order on 11/14, around 9:20pm, I wished I could know the half shaved bartender's name so I can add it in my review. 

We waited more than 40 minutes and got nothing except water. There was a guy who sat left next to us ordered his food from the same bartender the way much later than us but got his food when we were still waiting. It was just not right and when every time we asked the half shaved hair bartender where are our food, all she saying was it's coming. Such a Liar! She was not even felt sorry or apologized for this. Shame on her. I doubt she did it on purpose to us (Meaning she is on purpose to mess up our order or told the kitchen not to prepare the food for us) . After 50 minutes waiting and still got NOTHING, we decided to leave to stop wasting our time. 

I don't understand how come the place like this still can keep running their business if they treat their customers with this attitude.

Again! Final warning, Don't come to this terrible place! unless u r the person ok to wait ur food more than 50 minutes !
