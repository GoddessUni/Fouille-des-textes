I had missed lunch and just wanted something quick until I got home to dinner. I ordered the pick 2.  I stood at the counter and heard the front line talking about the food being old and a 4 minute wait on the fish sandwich (which would have been no problem) yet instead of asking me or letting me know they just gave me the old food. I asked for something different and the attitude came. The young lady in the pink shirt I thought was the supervisor came over snatched the food placed my new order then said very rudely that people make her job hard. I asked her (this same supervisor) for the corporate number she again very disrespectfully said ain't no corporate number I'll get the manager. I said never mind I found a number for corporate and was walking out the door when the manager chased me down and wanted to know what happened. I explained to her and she blew me off. I said I would call corporate and my office would no longer use them for our food drive she again blew me off and said yes they will. WOW!! And they want a pay raise!!! I had to pick 1 star for this location it does not deserve a star. The sign also said that it is owned by a veteran. As a veteran this is horrible!!!
