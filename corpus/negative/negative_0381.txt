We went as a group of 6 plus a toddler for lunch. It was not busy at all when we arrived and we were seated immediately. Our drink orders were taken quickly but it took close to 20 minutes to get them. All service from then on went downhill. We had to make multiple requests for napkins....our table had none when we sat down. Our raw bar options were delicious when we got them. As we waited we realized we had been seated an hour and twenty minutes and still did not have our lunch, or the soda my teenager had asked for. The food was great once we got it but we were so hungry by that point and our toddler was at her breaking point that we devoured our food and got out of there
