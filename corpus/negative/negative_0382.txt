The worst place!!! If you order from here make sure you check your bag before you leave because they probably messed up your order. They messed up my order 2x I gave another chance the second time around it was messed up again and as soon as I called to inform they did not even offer to remake the food they messed up. I asked for a refund and it 'only' took 4 weeks to receive it only after getting in contact with guest services since no one at the location was willing to do it. The management and communication is awful, I enjoy the food here and just wanted my meal to be remade correctly but after this incident it makes me not want to eat here again.
