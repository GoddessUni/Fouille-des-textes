It is sort of comical how this place is run.  We arrived about 5:30 on a Friday for dinner.  There are just two people working here.  They were too busy to even take our order. This despite the fact that only two other customers were there at the time. We had to wait a good 45 minutes to get our food.  When it arrived, it was pretty blah. I had the Oyster Po' Boy. I cannnot image what took 45 minutes to put 4 bread oysters onto a roll. I could have done this myself in about 3 minutes.  The portions are small, the food tops out at mediocre, and the service is truly awful.
