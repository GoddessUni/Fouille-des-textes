The food tastes very bad and banh mi is one of the worst in the area. Try Ba Le if you want good banh mi. The customer service at this place is horrible. Never been to a restaurant with this kind of rude service as here. The sale women there are extremely rude and snappy to customers. Do not come here if you want satisfactory customer service. You will get treated badly by the condescending sales women, especially the one with the bun that snaps at customers. The coffee tastes like diluted water and three times expensive than Dunkin Donuts. Banh Mi and other food tasteless. Last time coming this horrible place. Never coming here.
