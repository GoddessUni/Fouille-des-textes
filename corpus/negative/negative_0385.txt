This place left a menu at my doorstep a few weeks back.  I was in the mood for a wrap during a football Sunday and remembered that they offered wraps in addition to wings.

I ordered a buffalo chicken wrap and a garlic parm wrap.  Although both items were prepared carefully, I felt they were a bit off the mark.  The wraps are made like chicken salad, which means they have walnuts in them.  The nuts just didn't seem to fit in a buffalo chicken wrap.  The garlic parm wrap also had nuts in it, and was lackluster too.  Simply put, there really isn't anything to these wraps... just lettuce, chicken, nuts, mayo, and whatever wing sauce you pick.  Locally, the wraps at crazy bowls down the street are much better.  

I'll give them another try, but next time will steer clear from the wraps and instead just go for the wings that they're most known for.
