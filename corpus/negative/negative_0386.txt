We had dinner there this evening. One of the servers (who was very nice) was bumped into as she was carrying a full tray by our table. The tray hit my friend  Sharon, and the entire tray of food and drinks went all
over us and knocked over everything on our table. Our clothing was covered in water and margaritas. 

Having run a restaurant for 10 years in DC - we made sure the server was ok, she was mortified, we made sure she was ok. 

No manager ever came over. No-one helped the waiter we had (he was a brand new waiter, also mortified)

No one tried to make this experience up for us. Very disappointing. 

If it were a small spill, no big deal, but we lost everything on our table and were covered. We paid full price for a rough experience. You should not have to be nasty to have someone take care of. Your lack of customer experience and appreciation is extremely disappointing.
