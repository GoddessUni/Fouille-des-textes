We were a party of six and I was in charge of picking our lunch destination.  I searched several options on yelp and decided on Desire due to the reviews.   Really folks....some people should not be allowed to dine intoxicated then write a review. 

We had fresh oysters....good, white sauce is extremely spicy...loved it!
Oysters Desire...3 of 6 people really enjoyed...others meh.
BBQ oysters....4 of 6 really enjoyed...and 2 meh, they had grit in their oyster. 
BBQ shrimp....they were peeled unfortunately, I like the messy whole goodness.  Sauce was disappointing.
Trio..red beans, gumbo, and jambalaya...no one liked the jambalaya, gumbo and red beans were good.
Oyster Rockefeller poboy.....oysters were perfectly fried...otherwise as a whole meh.
Pork chops with greens and potatoes....amazing everyone loved this dish!
Fried platter...shrimp, oysters, fish, crawfish, crab cake and sweet potato fries...not greasy, average, but we were all full as it was the last course to be served.

Don't get me wrong....it was average NOLA food, nothing special.

If you do go.... order the pork chops and fresh shucked oysters, they were tasty.
