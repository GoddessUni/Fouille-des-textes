Today I took my boys to Keva Juice and had the worst experience. There were 3 people in line and clearly the big girl in the green shirt was stressed, rushed and rude especially to her co worker. As soon as we received our drinks I told the bigger girl in the green shirt I felt she was very rude to her co worker. She said " Whatever, have a good day". I asked for her name and she shouted " I can't hear you" and walked to the back.  I asked the black girl what her name was and she said "I can't do that" so I said I have no choice but to describe them both in my comments. So sad, I used to really like this place but the way the big girl talked to black girl totally turned me off!!! And my boys witnessed her ugliness!!!
