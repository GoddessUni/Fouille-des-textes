First and last time
We went to Jim Kelly's for dinner last evening. It was not a very good culinary experience. I was sitting at the bar waiting for my table, the hostess screamed out my name in my ear to alert me that my table was ready. I am sure it was not intentional, but it was certainly not necessary to scream. We sat at a table for two in a nice dining room. The waiter was pleasant enough. We were given corn cakes at the beginning of the meal, and they were the best part of the meal. I ordered the blackened creole rib eye, my wife had the baby lamb chops. A salad and potato come with the meal. I ordered a jack and coke and that took about 20 minutes to get to the table. The salad was terrible, it was presented terribly and was very soggy and drenched in dressing, the leaves were not cut,just thrown on the plate. We then waited over 30 minutes for our entree. The entree came, and the creole steak was charred, but flavorless, salt and pepper could not save it and we were not offered any type of hot or steak sauce. My wife's baby lamb chops were bland and tasteless. We ordered the apple/walnut cobbler for dessert, it came on a plate and looked like someone threw up on it, it was presented terribly and without any sense of plating. It did not taste bad, but overall, I would have been better off at the Longhorn steak house. I would not recommend this to a friend.
However, the place is packed and as we were leaving, the customers were out the door. All I can say is think twice before you drop over $200 on a meal. There are much better steak houses in Nashville to choose from.
