This location would definitely benefit from an undercover boss visit. Can't blame the employee's when the franchise owner can't buy enough inventory so that when you order an extra large ice tea there is actually an extra large cup in the inventory. To be charged for an extra large ice tea when you only have medium cups left in stock is highway robbery. Not the employee's fault .....

Wonder if the employee's actually even get paid. There is a great drive thru girl there and sometimes you can get a really good burger... I would place my poor review on the poor franchise owner not doing his or her job......
