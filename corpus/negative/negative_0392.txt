The food was ok but man the service was horrendous!!!!!!! I had two separate orders and a question about the size of the different things on the menu so that I could order something appropriate as it was my first time there. The girl behind the counter acted completely aggravated and very rude with my TWO questions. I ordered them stepped over to pay. There were two girls standing at the cash register, I had two separate orders and for whatever reason each of them decided to take one but ask me questions at the same exact time. I told them to please talk to me *one* at a time as they were both asking me the same thing about each order "if I wanted to naf it up with French fries". Really!?? I go to answer and the girl who was making my second order starts yelling at me from 5 feet away if I want veggies and pickles on the second order. Since I'm at the register trying to answer these two robots talking over each other, I don't hear her and she gets annoyed and yells "hey lady I talkin' to you!" Stunned, I look up and I'm like "um, what?!" I tell her to just add the veggies and I am humiliated in front of everyone else in line. Awful. Then I turn back to the cashiers to pay for my orders and again they ask (AT THE SAME TIME) if I want to "naf it up". I COUDN'T WAIT TO GET THE HECK OUT OF THERE!! Where do they find these people????!!!!!
