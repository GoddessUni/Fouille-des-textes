I'd think twice about ordering from The Avenue for delivery!  I've order from here a handful of times, but tonight after ordering a few items on Uber Eats, the food arrived to my door in the plastic bag tied tight (as usual). However, the driver warned me that the restaurant seems disorganized and he had to ask the person at the restaurant to tie up the bag.  He said I may want to call the restaurant bc he's never had that experience before picking up from this place. Sure enough after getting it inside, the items were mixed up in containers and I didn't get everything.  I promptly called The Avenue to get them to address the issue, and instead got a manager that wanted to argue with me about that couldn't be their fault and it must be the driver and I needed to call and take it up with Uber because she isn't a delivery service. Not the sort of customer service I expected and I won't be ordering or visiting them again.
