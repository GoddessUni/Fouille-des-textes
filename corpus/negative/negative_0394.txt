My family and i came to this establishment to celebrate my sister's 30th birthday,there were 13 of us.The restaurant  was 1/4% occupied. ( They were not busy)Our waitress was nice ,however she forgot to put in 5 of our orders and served a completely different  order then what was ordered for 1 of the orders. The rest of the meals were correct  but they came an hour after ordering. We asked to speak to a supervisor and he was rude, unkempt and wore a baseball cap. He never gave us his name. He had an attitude the entire time we spoke. He did give us 50%off of our meal and that was for our inconvenience.  I asked if we would recieve our 25% off for being locals and his reply was " either take the 50% or the 25% or nothing. I have never been treated so rude. We never got to sing Happy Birthday to my sister and all left upset. This happened between 430pm-6pm on 10/12/2019. VERY DISAPPOINTING  EXPERIENCE!!!
