This was our forth year, to come to M&S veterans appreciation lunch and what a disappointing event. 

M&S called us to offer the lunch, we accepted again and arrived for lunch.  Never was there a mentioned that a ID would be required for an appreciation lunch.  I am a veteran I don't carry an ID?  I explain to the waitress and she wouldn't budge. I had to search my email for a saved DD224 that I had recently used for a home loan Extremely embarrassing experience. Top it off $12 to pay....never had to in the last 4 years has we had to pay parking or offer ID.   Plus the wife wasn't covered for the first time.  Never again
