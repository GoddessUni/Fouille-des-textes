Ate here for the first time and will never come back. Service was bad, food was bad, drinks from the bar were bad. Had the driest lemon garlic chicken ever. Complained to the waitress and she offered some sauce to moisten it up. That wouldnt help, this was day old  chicken, because parts of the chicken was just plain inedible. Like when you reheat chicken several time over the edges start to get hard. Thats what they served, when it should have never made it out of the kitchen. Our waitress could have starred in Houdini, because she always dissappearing for long periods of time. The garlic potatotes were also cold and not very good at all. Will never come back to this place. Diners beware.........Eat here at your own risk!!!
