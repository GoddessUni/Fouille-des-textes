I've eaten at China King for several years, however, I will never go back after my last experience. The food was only average anyway.
I called and ordered pick-up. The lady who answered & took my ordered seemed "stressed".
I asked if I could pay over the phone. They preferred not to do that. No worries. 
I drove there to pay for the order so I could surprise my girlfriend, who was going to pick it up on her way over. 
I paid the same lady who I spoke w on the phone- it was a busy phone & she was still stressed.
I told her my phone number- as I was paying, I asked if the order was ready, & she said no. I then told her I was paying but I was surprising my girlfriend by paying for it. The lady brightened up & said "Awwww, that's so sweet." She looked at my order again- & said "I'll be sure to tell her that & just hand her the order."
Great, grand, perfect. 
Girlfriend got there right at the 20 minute wait time they gave us. 
First- my girlfriend almost left without food b/c the lady said she didn't have an order for my phone number. As she was leaving the lady finally remembered, called her back & told her it was paid for & it wasn't ready. 
My girlfriend waited an additional 20 minutes.
They forgot the crab rangoon.
I called- drove back- walked in & they handed me the rangoon.
Other than that, the egg rolls were the nastiest things I've ever tasted. I truly feel somebody accidentally made them w the wrong ingredients.
Needless to say, we won't return. There are other choices just as good.
