Based on some of the other reviews I have to think that we showed up on the wrong day. We walked in with our 3 kids and stroller and the first thing we heard was, "You cannot bring that stroller in here." We parked it outside and sat down. We didn't get menus until a waiter finally came over to take our order then realized we had no menus. The place was practically empty but it took a good 30 minutes for our food to arrive. Our 2 orders of french toast, waffle, and biscuits & gravy were all over cooked, the biscuits and gravy were overcooked and overly salty. I am not one to send food back, but I sent back the waffle. It was replaced with a waffle cooked just past raw. We ordered juice (no alcohol) for everyone and drinks alone were $15 - $3 for a kids juice?! The side orders of meat were very small (1 piece of bacon & 2 sausage links). We left feeling like we got ripped off. We ordered 4 things (one of which was oatmeal) and the bill was over $50. 

If you have a car, drive yourself up to Clear Sky Cafe in Clearwater Beach. It's worth the ride. We left Lisa's thinking of Clear Sky; a perfect beach front breakfast place we visited on our last visit to the area.
