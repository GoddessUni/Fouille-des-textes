First impressions are lasting and I won't be back unless I stumble out of one of the bars nearby and go in with "hoagie goggles"...

I feel like I should be on an old Wendy's commercial when I look at their sandwich..."WHERRRE'S the MEAT"??  Yes, they're friendly and it's a clean place which is great and all, but I've been to plenty of dive's where the waitress yells at me but they have great food, so I go back.  

The sandwiches need more to them.  Guys, charge a little more and give me a stuffed sandwich, otherwise I won't bother to find a parking spot(which isn't easy around there) to go buy one of your sandwiches. 

I'd rather go to Wawa and get their understuffed and below average hoagie...at least I can get in and out easy.
