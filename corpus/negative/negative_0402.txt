Well overrated. Food was just ok and service, which they are known for, was not good. 
Tried multiple times a day to get a reservation but they were totally booked up. Finally got lucky, there must have been a cancellation, but when we got there the restaurant was empty. Only, a few other tables in the whole place were filled. 
I understand the difficulties COVID has brought and that it is hard to staff now, but this is a restaurant I would definitely have expected more from. I understand we need to be lenient with restaurants right now but also diners have the right to know what to expect. If you have a high expectation of this restaurant you should ahead of time  that it will not be what you think.
