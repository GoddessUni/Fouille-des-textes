went to the dinner for the 1st time today and had the 1.99 special. it was delicious and my server was excellent. unfortunately my server (who seemed to be the only one working the floor.) was publicly ridiculed and admonished by three nasty beings behind me.  apparently the server (cleaned and well groomed compared to the rest of the staff) made the wrong toast. somebody plese tell the idiot that sat behind me when she went to spell out rye for the woman of spanish decent there is an e after the ry she kept repeating. when the harried waitress went to the back to fix the order one of the other waitresses had the audacity to loudly tell another table of patrons that she didn't know where their server wqs so she was going to have to take their order. (this was one of the four waitresses standing in the back with their arms folded doing nothing but complaining about our server. incidently i had to put up with listening to the loud mouths behind me declare for all to hear that they weren't going to tip her because she didn't deserve it.  frankly i wanted to throw my coffee on them but my boyfriend wouldnt let me.  the complaining idiots(cant spell rye) made me sol angry i couldnt see straight. they went right up to the counter where a very sloppy hostess sat and demanded a free breakfast..which i am sure they got..but when we went to leave and i asked for the floor supervisor or owner i was told he was to busy cooking. then i complained ! and tell you what, all i got was a "so". abe. the food (1.99 breakfast) was great, the service was fast, the diner was wanderfully clean.but get your staff to ask some of your patrons to remove their white hoods. and every single waitress there should be written up for obvious negative attitude displayed openly to a fellow associate.  how unprofessional. i 
left with a horrible taste in my mouth.
