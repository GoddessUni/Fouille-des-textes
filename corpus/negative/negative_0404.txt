One of the employees at my facility ordered a large Pizza and an order of French fries a couple of days ago. It took 1 hour and a half for the food to get here. The food was ice cold and I found a long piece of hair in the pizza. I called them to let them know since my employee had special needs. The person that answered the phone said they would send hot food to replace the cold food. I went home before the new food came and let the young lady know that hot food would be coming. When they arrived someone had thrown the food in the trash. The delivery man got into an argument with the security guard and called my special need employee a big fat liar which is unacceptable. I will not be going to eat here anymore and will tell everyone I know in the area to boycott a business that disrespects people with special needs and disabilities . GET YOUR FOOD UP TO TEMPERATURE BEFORE DELIVERING IT AND THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM. ALSO MAKE YOUR EMPLOYEES WEAR A HAIR RESTRAINT
