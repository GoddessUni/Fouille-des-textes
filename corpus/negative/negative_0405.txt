Not sure what others see in this place, was let down from the first bite. Super bland, one note dishes, plus dine-in meals served in styrofoam with tiny plastic utensils. Can I get like a tray or a plate or a metal knife to cut my chicken?

Kalua pig: super DUPER long stringy pieces, could not taste much at all? Had to douse in teriyaki, barely tolerable. Has such high hopes for this one specifically.

Pulehu chicken: tasted like I burned chicken on an old bbq out back and forgot to season it. 

Mac salad: honestly had better at the Albertsons deli. So disappointed since the mac is one of the best elements of Hawaiian food.

Hate leaving a bad review, but this gives Hawaiian food a bad name. We both felt like crap on the drive home, so greasy. Kanak Attack please come back to Meridian!!!
