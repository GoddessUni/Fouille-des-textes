OMG - I will cut to the chase.  Do not eat there.  My husband and I went to Camellia Grill on Carrollton at 5:30 pm Sat the 12th.  I ate a Ruben Sandwich and my husband a Roast Beef Sandwich and we shared onion rings.  We arrived home around 7:00 and by 8:00pm I was hugging a toilet.  AND NO IT WAS NOT ALCOHOL RELATED. I was so sick.  Today is Monday and feeling a little better.  My husband is a doctor so he immediately said Food Poisoning.  The place was not very clean and many flies.
The guy who waited on us wiped off the space where the grill is located and then wiped the counter.  How nasty.
All I can say is for everyone to be aware of the surroundings where you eat.  One person may not see the same things as another.  Flies in a restaurant are not clean.

BEWARE - BE CAREFUL - BE Smart
