Never giving this place my business again. I went there yesterday with a group of 10 people to get drinks and food. We were actually really quickly seated which was great since it was a holiday and super busy. 
The service and food were fine and the drinks were strong. As we began to collect money to pay for our check (which was at least $350) some of us decided to use the bathroom. My friend Ron came back to the table and told us he was being kicked out because they accused him of stealing an iPod. Now Ron is a techie guy, has an iPhone 6s etc...doesn't need to steal an ipod. The manager (some short guy who was semi bald and very pale) came to our table and told us we had to go. As we started to question him about why they were accusing him of stealing an iPod he told us that they never accused him of that but that one of his employees supposedly saw him disconcerting wires to their stereo system when all he was doing was standing in line for the bathroom. Now this makes no sense. Why the HELL would he mess around with wires. He then begins to yell at everyone at our table to get out and to calm down. 
After dropping close to $400 at this place to be treated like garbage is incredibly unacceptable. When we asked if they have video of proof of Ron disconnecting wires, they said they only had the eyewitness testimony of a "trusted" employee. BULLSHIT if you ask me. 
TO add to it- I was super sick that night most likely from the food there. 

Between the asshole management, being accused of stealing or attempting to steal, and having stomach pain from their food...we will NEVER return.
