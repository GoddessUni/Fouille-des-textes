Food is a 4. Service is a 1. Waited 45 mins for my order and no one was at the place when I first got there. It did pick up after I got there. My take out order was missing soups for all three of my entrees and one of the set of side dish. I try calling the store when I got home several times by all I got was busy signal. Food wasn't the issue. Hopefully they have better service in the future. Don't really have a Korean restaurant north of where they are located and the next closest place is 15 minutes south.
