I chose El Camino for dinner based in a good looking menu.  We were a party of 7 seated in the back room.  It was deafening loud.  We had to scream to hear each other.  We ordered chips and guacamole and salsa to start which was fine.  Then we all placed our orders.  And waited.  And waited.  And waited.  45 minutes later I asked to speak with the manager.  Then suddenly our food appeared.  The chicken tacos were not just spicy they were inedible spicy.  And the steak fajitas weren't much better.  The steak was so spicy  and chewy we just ate around it.  Shockingly the manager never came to our table.  And of course no one apologized for the long delay.  Perhaps this space is better for drinks outside.  We won't be back.
