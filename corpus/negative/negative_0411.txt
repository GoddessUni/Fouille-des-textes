Quick service and welcoming staff, but the food at El Fuego is anything but fuego (which means fire in Spanish). In fact, it was the most disappointing Mexican/Tex-Mex food I've ever had. 

My fianc√© and I were walking down Walnut Street when we decided to pop in here for lunch. Our order consisted of hard shell tacos for him and soft shell tacos for me. The hard shell tacos come four to an order while the soft shell tacos come three to order, and you're allowed to mix up the meats. I really appreciate that since it gave us the opportunity to try a few different kinds. 

I chose chicken, pork and chorizo for my three tacos. They were so bland and the meats were all cold which I definitely wasn't expecting. Cold taco meat is definitely a no-go for me. The chorizo was probably the best of the three, but that's not really saying much. The add ons that were available at the time were lettuce, cheese, sour cream and salsa, and although I got all of them they didn't do much for me. 

Staff was nice and very quick. Both of our orders were ready in just minutes. The restaurant seemed clean, although I can't comment on the restroom because it was out of order when we were there. 

I can't think of any time in the future when I'll be visiting El Fuego again. Yes, the service is fast for when you're on the go, but I can think of so many other places in Philly to go to for not just a quick meal but a tasty one too.
