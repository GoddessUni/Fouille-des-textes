I ordered a footlong which was only 10 inches long. Double Roast Beef with turkey and pastrami. I did not get what I ordered. They do not slice the meats fresh they use already sliced meats which is terrible. They probably gave me the wrong ingredients because they did not want to slice what I ordered. Pastrami one little thin slice less than 5 inches.  Rather than making me what I ordered the double roast beef they gave me double Turkey with just one piece of roast beef.  Shame on them. In addition also picked up a brownie which was tasteless not enough chocolate and somewhat dry. But their dill red potato salad was pretty darn good. And Adam the deli staff was friendly. Just don't let Ethan make your sandwich and make sure it is what you ordered not what meats they had already cut to give  you.
