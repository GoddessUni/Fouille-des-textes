Very cute place in the up and coming fountain square district.  

But....   

The food was average and would not recommend going back or wasting a good Italian dinner here!  

Few warnings... they do NOT make fresh pasta... but since they are just using hard pasta.. they should know how to cook it... both of our dishes were over cooked. 

They do not make fresh mozzarella.  

The service is slow.... we had empty drinks for far too long!  Not what you expect when paying over 100$ for dinner.

They no longer serve fried meatballs, but still have on menu... because they can't get consistency they said.  

That all being said...   the caprese and meatballs were good.  My fianc√© liked her ravioli besides being over cooked and once I dumped their tasty red sauce on one of the driest pasta dishes ever.. it was delicious!
