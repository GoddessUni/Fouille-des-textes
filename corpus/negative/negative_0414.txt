I was really hoping this place would impress but that didn't turn out to be the case when I visited Friday for lunch.  I ordered the Paleo Platter (which consisted of chicken, lamb, beef, veggies, and hummus) for $7.99 and a side of falafel for $4.99.

The presentation for both was nice and I thought the falafel tasted delicious but felt it to be way over-priced (for what I paid, each falafel 'patti' was $1)! The hummus was very good but I needed much more than I was served because the meat was all very dry! I couldn't even tell the difference between the beef and lamb but all of it had lots of fat on it, was very dry, and lacked in spices.

The service was pretty good but the food wasn't enough to bring me back again... Big thumbs down on this place.
