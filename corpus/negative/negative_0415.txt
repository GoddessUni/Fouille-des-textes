Every time I go to this Olive Garden they always find a new way to disappoint me! We went for lunch but after waiting 35 mins to be sat the lunch specials were over. Sat at our table for 20 mins and not 1 person came by to get our drinks. The hostess walked by us twice not once asked if we needed drinks or if our server had come by. (Turns out she sat us in a section that had no server) had to get most of the food to go since we had already been there a total of an hour waiting. Finally go to eat my soup at home. No gnocchi in it, and probably 1 1/2 pieces of chicken. I am shocked this Olive Garden is still up and running!
