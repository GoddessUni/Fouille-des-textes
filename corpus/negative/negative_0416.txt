Chopped salad was good but given to us in a Togo box which was weird since we were obviously eating there as we were set up with our kids at a table.  We ordered a veggie pizza that was nothing that you would expect a veggie pizza to be.  Just watery sauce and a few clumps of mozzarella with spinach leaves and no taste.  Immediately after it was delivered to our table, we tried it.  It didn't need cooling off and was a sloppy, mushy, wet piece of thin, undercooked pizza with no melted cheese.  We didn't even want to eat it, even though we were hungry.  Who likes wet, soggy bread as pizza??! I kindly told the cashier that we were not sure the pizza came out right and the woman who made the pizza came right over, not to apologize, but to defend her pizza, stating this is how it always is because of the sauce and mozzarella balls that are stored in water.  Also, they explained, when they over cook it, people complain so they don't cook it too much and this is what happens, like it was my fault for not being satisfied with the worst pizza I think I've ever experienced in my life.  They said they'd make me another but it would come out the same.  My thoughts? If you don't know how to make a good pizza in a brick oven with these ingredients, you need to work on the menu a bit.  Both the cashier and the cook seemed very defensive instead of accommodating and fair.  They offered to take the pizza off but the whole experience was awkward and draining.  Not only was I embarrassed for taking my family there, but was disappointed with the bad customer service and the way we got dirty looks from the staff while we ate the rest of the food.  We decided to take the rest to go bc we didn't feel like we were welcome anymore.  I give it 2 stars bc the kids food was decent and the salad as well.  Never going back unfortunately.
