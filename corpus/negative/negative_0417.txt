Eddie Vs used to be my top recommendation for steak in Tampa. Primarily because of the consistently excellent food and service, I would tell people if you are going to drop over $100 on dinner, Eddie Vs will not disappoint. 

Well the dismissive service and overcharging for drinks permanently changed my opinion of his establishment. 
My wife ordered a regular old fashioned yet we were charged $18 per a drink, my drink was supposed to cost $14, but was $17. Our waiter acted like he was doing us a favor when he corrected the overcharge on the old fashioned, but failed to correct my drink. I just paid and left and figured that if I wrote management, I would receive a response. Eddie Vs corporate indicated that "Stephen"would give me a call. That never happened even though I was told that someone would contact me at least twice. Stephen sent me an email claiming that he called me, totally unprofessional. Also the valet was annoyed when my wife asked him to take our picture and overall no one here gives a damn about my business. 

I spoke with a colleague in the hospitality business, she indicated that overcharging on drinks was a common method for stealing from customers and the restaurant.
