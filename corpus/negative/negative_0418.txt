Wanted to like this place, but unfortunately we won't be going back.  Hostess told us a 20 minute wait for a table.  Okay, we give our name, get a pager and wait outside on a beautiful night.  Not so bad.  About 25 or more minutes waiting, I check back with hostess.  I notice names after us are crossed off.  She assured me that we will be the next table.  We wait more.  Then others get seated.  I approach the hostess and she apologies and explains that the owner sat the other people.  So the reviews talk about how wonderful the owners of this place are, but they fail to tell you that you have to know them to be treated right.  After waiting 45 minutes and getting that response we left.  Never to return.
