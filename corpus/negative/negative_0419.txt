Wanted buffalo wings at 3AM while I was at the hospital, decided to go here but ugh. Worst buffalo wings I've ever had! They were soggy and salty and the cuts were just bad quality. The celery was super soggy and just disgusting... The service is nice which is the 1 star, but it was expensive for 6 wings... Around $10. I make them all the time at home and didn't think it'd be that hard to mess up, but boy did they mess up. The other 1 star is for giving me 3 blue cheeses when I asked for an extra.
