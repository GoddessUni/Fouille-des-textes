If you only order the wings and don't mind a slippery floor than I'd give this place a give 5 star rating....

The service: there are a couple good servers however overall the staff seems very inexperienced and or just don't seem to care. I honestly wanted to remind a couple of them they were working in the service industry. It was a bother when of ask for more beverages. It was the same sigh and "Your interrupting me" attitude weather it was soda or items paid per drink. Maybe it's just a young staff with a new manager...

Food: the wings are great. The chicken tenders are great. The pizzas are very hit or miss. They tend to under cook food when busy (non chicken items)

Bar: great staff and a good selection of beer. They are fairly knowledgeable about mixing spirits.

Atmosphere: slippery and dirty floor. Very loud in the  main seating. The booths are pretty tight.

Overall if you want wings and war in or at the bar you still love this place... With my family, I'll never go back.
