They have a long way to go to catch up with the consistent quality of their California locations. Service was poor, they messed up my order to go, sending me home with a greek instead of cobb salad. Computer went down in the middle of my order so my food sat on the counter until I had to ask for it. Customer call center would only take new orders. I think they have been bought out by a large company that only cares about profit. I liked it so much better 15 years ago. So disappointing after I had raved to my friends about it. Give them 6 months, maybe they will figure it out.
