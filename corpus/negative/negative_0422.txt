Wrecked our Author Signing

OMG...where do I begin?

The only reason I'm giving this hotel one star at all is because of their wonderful staff. Kenyon was our bell boy twice and he worked so hard and was funny and personable.

I am gluten free and at our author signing, which was planned a year in advance, one of the staff told me they had nothing for me to eat when I was told by our very capable organizer she had set this up for me.

I told her what was going on and after she got on them, I finally had some lunch.

We were an hour into our signing and found out that the hotel was turning our readers who had bought tickets to the signing away. The space was lovely, but if you paid $1,000+ to be at the signing and your readers are turned away...what's the use?

The hotel even lied to our organizer and told her they had only turned away a couple of people. Luckily, she had plenty of witnesses and they attested to the fact they turned almost our entire crowd away.

Why... because they didn't want people using their bathrooms during Mardi Gras. I can tell you I would never stay here. I stayed 2 hours away for  less than a third of the price. Some of my poor fellow authors were paying $300+ a night and then had the hotel screw them over in this manner.

If you are ever thinking about planning an event here, especially during Mardi Gras...better think twice.
