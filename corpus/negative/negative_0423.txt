My boyfriend and I went with a friend to banana leave after reading the reviews on yelp. We each ordered something different and I will say I am extremely disappointed. My friend loves banana leaf and always recommended coming here. The waiter was not very helpful on assisting us in what to order, it seemed like he was unsure on what was the best as well.  When we got our order our food was bland, almost tasteless, maybe they hired a new chef, who knows. I would not recommend going there, there are plenty of better restaurants to go to in Chinatown. I also want to mention we went at 3pm, we were the only customers there. Banana leaf is also very dark and gloomy.
