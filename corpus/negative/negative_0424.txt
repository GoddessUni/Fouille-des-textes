I can not leave the mall without buying these! But the last few times they have tasted stale, so disappointing! But believe it or not that is NOT the point of this review! 
(Yesterday, 10/11/19) 
...What made matters worse, the blonde lady acted like she didn't want to sale us anything...(hell I already knew what I wanted) She just told my mom and me to let her know when we were ready...(um can I get a hi, how are doing, damn we are in the south! Manners!) I had to ask for a bag (she gave me this big ass black bag) and I had to get my own receipt from behind her register because she walked off! She didn't say Thank you, bye, kiss my ass, nothing... oh Wait she did say that the first receipt was hers. And proceeded to whatever she was doing!  I gave this review a 2 for the cookies... a bad review because of her funky ass attitude!!
