I ate two nights in a row at The Lark with different parties wanting to try the "new place in the Funk Zone."  The d√©cor is fun and well done; inside is crowded and noisy on weekends.  The staff tries hard, but having to listen to a long list of plate sharing ideas and overly-descriptive preparations is a bit much.  The menu is very trendy - every new eatery now has kale, beets and Brussels sprouts on the menu, but herb-crusted bone marrow - really?!  The food was good, not great, and a little pricey.  I can pass on a third visit.
