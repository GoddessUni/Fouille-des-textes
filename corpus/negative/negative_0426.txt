My husband and I went to Bernie's for brunch this Sunday. They were having a buffet format due to the Hatboro Christmas parade later in the day which we were fine with ($22 per person). We were seated and ordered drinks. Twenty minutes later we were still staring at our ordered drinks by the bar that nobody had bothered to bring to us so my hubby finally walked up and got them himself (there were only two other couples there at this point and one of them were good friends of ours).  We finally asked if the buffet was ready after sitting for thirty minutes and they told us it was ready. As we walk up there was some food but not everything was out yet and very limited amounts. The food itself was fine but $15 per person would have been a better amount for what they served. The kicker for us was that when our bill came they had added a tip of 20% to the bill. The service was awful, the food okay and we will NEVER grace them with our presence again!!!
