Been here several times and have always had awesome service. Went here today and it was horrible! There was no one to greet myself and my children and we stood there for a good 5 mins before someone came. Our food took about 30 mins to come and my sons order was wrong but the waitress insisted it was right until I showed her the actual picture then she had the cool redo it and it took an additional 20 mins just for 2 kiddie chicken bites! My burger was rare even though I said well done. Never received refills. She never checked on us, I had to flag her down for boxes which 15 mins later she never bought so I had to get up and ask another waitress. In total I was there 2 hours for horrible service and this used to be my fave restaurant
