I really really wanted to like this restaurant. It's got easy parking, on upper State away from the crowds, was hoping for an easy late lunch after a few hours at close-by Hendry's Beach. I went with my son visiting from LA. He ordered shrimp skewers, an appetizer. He got 3 medium sized shrimp for almost $12. Really?
My Greek salad was 90% cut up bell peppers with a few kalamata olives, a few pieces of cucumber and a slight sprinkle of feta cheese. 
There is nobody to talk to about the food because it is ordered at the countered and delivered by the "chefs" directly from the kitchen. No wait staff.
Won't be returning.
