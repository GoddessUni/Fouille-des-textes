First wiff- cheese and teenager's feet.
Ordered the seafood linguine, al dente. $23.00

Came out as an Alfredo cheesy sauce that sat under heat lamps for long enough to over-cook the pasta and turn the seafood grey.  I lived in Napoli for 3 years...I'm sorry, but you never serve seafood in a cheese sauce.  

Sadly, I had to waste food and send it back.  Came out again, no cheese (but waiter asked "would you like some cheese". Jeez man, put that effing cheese away.
Par-cooked pasta, so it was still mushy, just bad all around.  

Al Dente pasta should snap when you bite it... it was a mushy mess.  Sorry gang, but your food is sub-par.  Send someone to Italy for a week so that they can do it right.  It's an easy food to cook, just use good ingredients and simple cooking techniques.  

What a let down.
