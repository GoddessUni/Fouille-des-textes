This place is horrible!!!!! It was my first time here with my dad. He got veil chop and I got veil parm. The chop was tough, dry, and didn't taste like what veil chop should taste like. My veil parm was horrible. The meat was so tough. I had to use most of my strength to cut it. It took me 30 seconds to chew on a small piece of veil. I didn't even chew the veil fully before I ate it! I was just tired of chewing, so I swallowed. Their ziti was not anything like ziti, it was also chewy. It took three quarters of an hour to get 2 entr√©es out! The soup and bread were mediocre. And we never got a refill on our water once! Also, the cheek took ten minutes to get to us! The place wasn't even that full! I am never coming here again!
