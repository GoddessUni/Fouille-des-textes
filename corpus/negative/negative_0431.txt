I thought this would be good since I was in a southern state and they are somewhat known for decent bbq but I was wrong.

My friends and I got takeout here Sunday evening . I ordered the chicken meal, which comes with two sides, and a cornbread. I chose baked beans and mac n cheese for my sides. The chicken did not have any flavor, it was undercooked (still pink on the inside) and dry. The beans and the cornbread were good, and the mac n cheese was ok. On a positive note the staff is very friendly. 

I guess I had high expectations since the bbq place I frequent in CT never disappoints. I don't plan on returning to this establishment  if I'm in the area.
