I went to the one located at The Shops at Liberty Place in Center City as I work the next block over. HUGELY disappointed! I don't understand the flat "muffin top" on the cupcake. Professional cupcakes aren't supposed to look like that. It had a flat muffin top that looked like too much batter was used and it spilled over. The muffin top was also uneven, a lot on once side and hardly any on the other. Now, getting to the icing. It was way too soft. It looked like ice cream melting off the cone. It was not too hot out that day either, in the 70's. The icing was dolloped on the cupcake, no decorations or anything else. Ok, so in the bake shop, there were only a few flavors left in the display. Various arrangements of chocolate and vanilla and a sweet potato one. When I go to a bakery for cupcakes, I want something different than chocolate and vanilla, so I got the sweet potato one. Took it back to my office and had it for dessert after lunch. The icing was so sickeningly sweet that it hurt the back of my throat. Hours later, I still felt that "hurt" in the back of my throat and my stomach felt sour. The cupcake itself was ok. Nothing special. It was moist. 

It was the sloppiest looking cupcake I ever bought from a baker, professional or otherwise. Will not be stopping by there again. I'll stick to Philly Cupcakes even though they are several blocks further from my work. It'll be worth the walk.
