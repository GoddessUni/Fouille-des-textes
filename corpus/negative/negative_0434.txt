OK, first off let me say I love this place and have been coming here on and off for many many years. I bring out of towners here all the time. Today, my wife and I went for lunch, our waitstaff was great as always, the food was great as always, We ordered 1 hamburger, 1 hamburger poboy, 2 fries, 2 coffees, 1 ice tea and a slice of pie with a scoop of ice cream. Couldn't have been a better lunch until l I went to the cashier to check out. The total was $56.22!!! WTF? I stared at the bored looking guy behind the register, "I'm sorry, what?" $56.22 he said again handing me a receipt. I said "That's impossible, show me". He proceeded to show me our order slips the waiter filled out which had no prices on them, he then showed me our receipt, which had no prices on it and said "Its what the computer says" and just stared at me blankly and refused to go any further with the conversation. 

Now being an experienced New Orleans resident, I immediately think since he saw an Austin Public Library t-shirt I was wearing, he scammed me. Whether that's is true or he was just stupid and refused to go over it with me, I dont know but I got ripped off for what was more or less a $30 lunch and the cashier couldn't have cared less. That's not the Camellia Grill Ive known for 15 years.
