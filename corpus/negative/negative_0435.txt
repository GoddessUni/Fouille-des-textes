Vegan options are decent but there is ALWAYS an issue when trying to do pickup orders. Sometimes they offer it, sometimes not. Seems like it depends on their mood. They started offering door dash so I ordered on there, paid and a driver was dispatched. When he got there he was told the restaurant turned off the doordash app and were not doing it for the rest of the day. What? Not sure if it's the new management or what. This place used to be a go to for me but now I just suck it up and make my own tofu scramble.
