Went here for the first time yesterday to kill some time before the Chris D'Elia show at the Troc. Pretty neat place with a great atmosphere. A lot of beers to choose from (another plus). After ordering a drink, we got some food. The mini nacho bowl was huge, but that's at. Not enough cheese or toppings. My buffalo chicken bites tasted like they came from a frozen box and the chicken was a bit chewy or freezer burned. So if you're looking for a good spot for happy hour then Bar-Ly is definitely a great place. For food, I'd probably head anywhere else.
