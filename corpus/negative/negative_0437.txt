Awful & Confusing. This place is a prison yard filled with young corporate knock offs and Pelican Bay bouncers. I did not like anything about IBG apart from its name. We arrived from Jersey on a charter (party bus - great by the way. Will get the name of the company and review. Top Notchery) for a friend's birthday at 9:10 PM. Kitchen closes at 10 and we were not able to order food. This place is run by the Foot Clan from Ninja Turtles. Kids skating on walls and cigarette cartons being sold. "We've been waiting for you Miss O'Neil".

Good Notes:
Bouncers are nice
Plenty of Lawn Game areas 
Super open space
Menu read well. Food would have swayed my opinion here...

Not so good Notes:
Super open space
Hard to gauge and navigate - it looks like some guys waited for a corporate complex to close and just threw a disorganized kegger party in the complex's atrium. Some Mack Cali ish. Subpar version of Project X. Just bad.
Bathroom situation confusing
Way too many Nooks & Crannies to get lost
Bartender had to be the worst ever. Should not be able to pour in the diviest of bars. Should not be able to pour liquor out for "the homies who aint here" (watch a bone thugs music video). Just the worst.
No suggestions on drinks or beer
Very small selection of drinks in general
It sucks
It's not good 
And it sucks.

Not a fan of negative reviews but I could not let this one slide. Sorry. 

Verdict:

Operations are sloppier than a soup sandwich. Stop giving the city of brotherly love and awesome joints a bad name. Sorry Philly keep your cheese steaks and constitution square. I'll stick to NY/NJ/CT/RI for tri-state fun. This place hurts your rep. Send it to Delaware or something. Unbookmark this shitshow and save yourself the trouble. Grab a can of Miller High Life and sit on a random stoop for a better biergarten experience. Get your ish together or close down thanks.
