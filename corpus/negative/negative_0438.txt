As a New England native, ( Mass.) we know good Italian food. While staying in St. Petersburg, I decided to try the closest restaurant to us. This was Gigi's. What a disappointment to put it mildly. I got veal parm w/ penne pasta. As I tasted the pasta, I had the thought of Hunts TomatoSauce right out of the can. It had that uncooked, acid, metallic taste. The veal was also unremarkable. Almost an off taste. I had visions of Gordon Ramsey ranting in the kitchen. Even the Caesar Salad was sub par. Salty dressing, unflavored croutons, lettuce that was more white parts than fresh green leaves. The reason for the one star is for the garlic bread and cannolis. 
  I feel as if I was part of a contest to " Find The Best Tourist Trap!
I would be curious to know where they found their chefs who cannot make a simple tomato sauce! Definitely NOT restaurant quality food. If this wasn't take out, I would have sent it back.
