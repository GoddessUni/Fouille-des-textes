I am at the New location  in Horsham Pa this is my 2nd time here. The bar staff sucks. You have to flag someone down to get a drink. The 1st time I waited 15 mins and left. Came ba,k to try again today. This time after 10.mins I flagged someone down. I was not the only one that had to do this. All you G women bartenders  they need some men or people  with more experience.   However the you G lady who waited on our table was good but the menu is extremely  limited  an extreme disappointment. Guess I'll be going back to Ft Washington at least three the food menu is big the service is good but still not a variety  in the type of staff no people of color. Not a good look MaGerks you must diversify.
