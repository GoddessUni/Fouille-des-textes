Do not go on a Saturday! Tried to go today and first stood outside in the direct sun (no shade) in 95 degree temps for about 10 minutes. We were happy to get inside and continued to wait in line (it's fast casual, so you order at the counter) for another 5 minutes when we learned that there was going to be a 45-50 minute wait for food AFTER we finally reached the front of the slow-moving line. Plus, there was nowhere left to sit -- people who had already ordered were standing in the middle of the restaurant waiting for a table to open up. We eventually gave up and went to Mas Tacos, which also was crowded, but knows how to get food out fast. I'd understand it if it was Redheaded Stranger's first day, but they've been open for 6 weeks now, and they need to figure out how to deal with a busy lunch crowd. Hire more people or do what you need to do, but right now, your potential customers are leaving because your restaurant doesn't have its act together.
