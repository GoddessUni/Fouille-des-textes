We gave up on Wu's a long while ago after their quality hit the tubes.

We were excited to see the location "reborn" as Grace Bistro, with new blood and new management. We gave them a shot the other night. Unfortunately, we ended up disappointed.

The young man who took my order over the phone did a fine job. We picked up, and the food was ready on-time. That's in their favor. First warning sign was a Chinese restaurant that had run out of chopsticks. Then, the food.

We had mainstays of any Chinese menu - sweet & sour chicken, General Tso's chicken, egg rolls, and a Chinese Pizza/Scallion Pancake. The disappointment got underway quickly.

The Sweet & Sour didn't come with enough sauce. The General Tso was "meh", and the scallion pancake was downright terrible.

We usually order from Mulan, over on Evesboro-Medford Rd, who delivers in a short time, and is excellent quality as well as very tasty, two qualities that Grace can't match up on. Hopefully they improve, but as of today, I wouldn't return.
