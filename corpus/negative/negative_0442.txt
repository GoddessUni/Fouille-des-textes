I Travel all over the nation and visited ihop all over. This ihop in New Orleans is the worst by far period. 

- I witness a kitchen employee not washing his hands after using the toilet. ( after my breakfast was eaten, not a good feeling, I'm glad I'm ok)

-worst untrained staff

- waited 35 min to get cold scrabble eggs and cold pancakes ( come on!)

- when got my juice half of server finger was inside my orange juice, really!


- table all in the middle and baby chairs blocking emergency exit, this is a death trap is something happen ( fire, earthquake, etc) in this restaurant. 

Avoid at all times, avoid e-coli from the cooks.
