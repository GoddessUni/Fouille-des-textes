Welp....that was disappointing.  Literally nothing in this place actually tastes like barbecue. The chicken was dry and tasteless. The ribs were dry and tasteless. The catfish sandwich was unseasoned and drenched in like a tartar sauce coleslaw mixture that was gross and made it soggy in less than 10 minutes. The only meat that had any flavor at all was the pulled pork and even that tasted like it was just baked. The greens were tough and OMG the mac and cheese was some kind of gritty cheese sauce that tasted like mac and cheese mixed with potato salad somehow? I'm almost convinced that good barbecue is never going to happen in AZ. Scratch this off the list.
