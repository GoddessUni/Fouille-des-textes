Well the ambiance is nice but the seats are to cramped. The service is great but the haddock was no more then fish sticks. I thought I was going to get a actual piece of fish and got like I said fish sticks. You can actually buy these sixteen dollar fish sticks the same exact thing in shoprite.The damn fries are a joke shoe string fries for adults are a joke. This haddock plate needs a revamping its a joke. If ur not going to serve real fish then take it off the menu. I give this place another year before it'll be gone.
