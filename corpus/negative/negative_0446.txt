I go here often since they have really great salads and soups.  I got converted when Souper Salad closed across the street.  Never really have a bad time until today.  Went with friends to the Sunday Brunch.  13.27 for breakfast.  This was HORRID!!!! Scrambled eggs NO FLAVOR, Country Scramble (not sure what country this was from) little flavor.  Bricks and gravy  (biscuits could be used for bricks), no meat any where on the station other than the sausage in the gravy or bacon bits on potato bar.  The best thing to eat there was the fruit loops.  I think next time I will spend the extra 15.00 and go to a resort for their Sunday Brunch.
