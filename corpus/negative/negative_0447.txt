I have no idea what the reviewers below were thinking but this was BY FAR the worst sushi and sushi experience we have ever had! For starters, the sake was lukewarm at best. The poke salad was drenched in some sort of sauce with no flavor and the fish was FAR from tender. The fish being raw should not be "chewy". Had the Gustavo roll based on others reviews. Chopped tuna with a ton of rice around it- nothing like the description. And it tasted like dog food. We sent that roll back and the server had the nerve to tell us-after we said the roll was disgusting-well that is the Gustav roll. She did not ask if we wanted anything else to eat or drink and did not come back until we flagged her down for the bill. By the way, it was 5:00 and there were a total of 4 customers in the entire place at the time. 

Overall I give this place 0 stars for food and if I could give a negative for service I would! There are many other sushi places in this city-AVOID ORIGAMI!!!!
