Our visit to this location was on Saturday November 16, 2019, at about 10 am for breakfast. We were not acknowledged by the hostess as she was reading and explaining the menu to someone on the phone. After several minutes we asked to be seated and she said she was busy but she would seat us. We waited some time to have someone ask us for our order.  The wait for our food was considerable but it was Saturday... food finally came , pepper shaker was totally empty.(maybe someone missed their side work?) During our wait two women and a little girl about 3 was seated behind us. The child started screaming and crawling under the table, no action was taken by either adult. The little girl began to bounce and jump on the seat behind us finally punching my companion in the head. My companion said " Hey, cut it out!" and the mother came unglued! " don't tell my child  what to do!"  We didn't get to finish our meal and had no check, but decided to leave. Mind you the mother was screaming she was going to call the police because my companion  spoke to her child. Alexis was the manager, nice but defintely not in charge! She appeared after we asked for her and comped our meal. We probably won't return .
