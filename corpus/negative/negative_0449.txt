DO NOT BRING YOUR MONEY HERE... I was verbally assaulted at this place just last night 11/14/2020 by the security guy and a girl name Jeibi or Jeyme a white girl... I called before heading to the place since I live 30 minutes away and I really wanted their wings. Once I step into the building the security guy had a  bad attitude and said they do not take orders and I have to do it online... I asked him to please call a server because I had call prior and they provided a diffident information.... long story short they do not care about their costumers is a shame because it's a nice place but the employees need a better training the girl was completely rude and did not even want to provide me instructions to order... EVEN DURING THE WORKD CRISIS THAT WE ARE GOING THROUGH SOME BUSINESS STILL DONT CARE ABOUT THEIR COSTUMERS...
