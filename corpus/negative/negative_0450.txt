Very disappointed with Noah's. We ordered a Santa Fe salad which is supposed to come with corn, salsa, cheddar cheese, tomatoes, and tortilla chips. We received a small sandwich size container with just ice burg lettuce and grilled chicken. None of the other toppings! The cheese was a congealed nacho cheese sauce on the side. Worse than Taco Bell cheese whizz. And the "salsa" was marinara sauce! Laughable! Also, we ordered chicken fingers which melted through the styrofoam container and had a nice side of soggy fries. And, when we went to pick up the food the credit card machine was down. Unprofessional and irresponsible food establishment. Bummer because we live nearby and were excited about this new place close by. Won't be ordering from Noah's again.
