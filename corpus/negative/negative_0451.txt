I made a reservation for last Saturday night for a group of 6.  4 Adults one 4 year old and one 18 month old.  When we arrived I had a feeling things were not going to go smoothly.  The first impression of a restaurant is often delivered by the host/hostess.  When we walked in, we were greeted with a mumble and a frown from the hostess.   It was as if she wasn't in the mood to open her mouth.  After being seated we were assaulted with the constant banging and slamming of the door that separated the hotel lobby and the restaurant.  The noise ruined the ambience and was a constant interference in our dinner discussions.  $10 at the hardware store would have solved this problem... but instead, those in charge of this operation allow a $10 problem to ruin the dining experience for their customers.
 
Moving on to the food and service.... I must say that our server was an absolute delight.  Very accommodating, friendly, and quick.  She was fantastic.  Unfortunately her service was over shadowed by a limited menu selection and below average food.  We ordered several small plates and a few sandwiches and salads.  Everything missed the mark except for the peanuts roasted in thyme, honey and brown sugar.  It's pretty sad when peanuts are the best part of the meal.   In addition the menu describes their wings as "grilled" but they arrived deep fried.  The Pesto shrimp were over cooked and dry as well.  The food was disappointing but was more disappointing was the decision someone made to add gratuity to a party of 6 that included an 18 month old and a 4 year old who split a grilled cheese & chicken tenders and had one cup of water each.   Poor decisions all around from this place
