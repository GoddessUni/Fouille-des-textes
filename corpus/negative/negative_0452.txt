Had a great first experience a few weeks ago, so we brought some visitors from out of town there.  It was a horrible experience.  We waited over 1 and 1/2 hours in line.  No explanation or apology, no acknowledgment, just ignored.  Finally the line started moving and the tables were half empty, apparently the kitchen was busy (imagine that) and they just stopped taking orders.  Don't know if they are set up to handle a busy crowd.  Standing in line doesn't work here, they need to switch up their operation.  If there is no line or you can wait it out, the food is good, but on this day it really turned us off.
