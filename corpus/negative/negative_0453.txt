We went shopping at Target in Trinity Sat May2nd and were very disappointed. No one was wiping and cleaning the carts, there was nothing available to clean the cart yourself. Tall, large young man standing by the carts counting people who were coming in, I asked him if he was cleaning the carts he said no it's not his job. Asked who's job was it he said it was not his problem. In the mean time more carts were coming in from outside and no one was cleaning them. I asked for some cleaner and I will wipe down a cart myself. He turned around and walked away. Needless to say we walked out and went to Publix. We won't be back.
