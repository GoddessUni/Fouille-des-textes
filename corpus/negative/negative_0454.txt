I had the worst experience of my life going to toast 101 (coming from a server). Our server( also the manager) Tish, decided she didn't feel like serving us today and only stopped by about three times. We ordered doughnuts and a Bloody ( the bloody took 25 min to come out). The doughnuts we never got. When we finally got our food after waiting 45 min, Tish didn't bring it to us she was busy talking to her coworkers. And when we notified her our doughnuts never came out she said she would take it right off the bill before even asking us if we still wanted them. The bacon was raw, banana pudding French toast tasted sour, the BLT had a pound of Mayo and the chicken fried steak was worse than a frozen Marie Callender's. Over all this is the worst place to go and it pissed me off so much I wrote my first ever Yelp review! I hope you guys get a new manager/ new server :)
