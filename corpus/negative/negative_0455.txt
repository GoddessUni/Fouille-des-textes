Eh....stopped in here for dinner while in town for business. (Yes I was by myself - gasp!!). Upon entering I was offered to sit at the bar or a table...uh I did reserve a table, and have no problem sitting alone, sorry to have inconvenienced you! Ordered the ice burg salad to start - subpar, should be removed from the menu!  It is literally an inch thick cut of iceberg with some tomatoes, bacon and croutons on top...seriously??? For $9!????  Drum meuni√®re was the only redeeming quality for this evening. For dessert I ordered the king cake donut that comes with bananas fosters sauce. Bananas were hard and starchy-extremely green bananas??  It was pretty gross!  I regret having dined here and would not come back
