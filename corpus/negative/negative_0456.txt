Just to advise I went to the Unit on Bourbon street. 

Beignets were good - bit too much sugar on them, I ended up looking like Tony Montana after eating just one, service on the beignet counter was just awful. I approached the counter, girl sat there ignoring me eventually interrupting my wait to tell me she didn't serve cocktails. 
Ordered beignets and then went to order the most watered down tasteless cups of artificialness that have ever been called a cocktail.

They have some jazz guys there that are acceptable but when you pay over the odds for beignets and crap cocktails to have some dude come round with a  hat asking for money like a busker you know it is time to hit the street.
