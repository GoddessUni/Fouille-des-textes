Sorry but today was my last meal at this diner. Too bad as it had been a favorite. I ordered a tuna melt and it was just gross. Encrusted with globs of cheese. The tuna was an unusual color. I am now a bit nauseous. Not sick but ick.The ketchup tasted funny too. it's in Heinz containers but it either isn't Heinz or it's never been refrigerated and went bad. The waitress was good.
On my way in I saw something that should have been a warning... a man was putting some kind of brown substance into a takeout box that had something like brown thick glue on top, I'm guessing, gravy. I don't know, maybe the regulars like this kind of thing but I find it disgusting and needing an update.
