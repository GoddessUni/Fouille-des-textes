We tried to love Coyote Crossing. We tried again and again, but this place always seems to fail us. We've ordered take away from there many times and never without a hitch. Usually there's incorrect items, or the order was never taken down so we have to wait when we arrive, or one time, the restaurant didn't have change when we paid with cash. The food is usually a miss, with very few exceptions. I ordered fajitas in which the veggies were barely cooked, almost raw, and everything had a bland taste. We also ordered standard margaritas there while waiting. The drinks came out of a soda gun and were far too expensive.
