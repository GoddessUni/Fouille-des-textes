We waited a long time for this location to open.  One star for the prices.  Cheap eats are a tough to find in Oro Valley.  This was our third visit and our last, we've given it a fair try.  Non smiling and unfriendly staff.  We were seated quickly and chose to eat in the bar section to avoid crying, screaming children and hoped to see the baseball game too.  Roberto waited on us again.  His English is poor and he doesn't listen to you when you order.  Only a couple of the big screens were on.  The rest were turned off or broken.  Roberto took my husbands drink order first, served him first and my meal order was wrong  and had to be returned to the kitchen to include the sides that I originally ordered.  Sigh. (Roberto doesn't seem to think that women are important enough to listen to) Worst Martini that I've ever had in this lifetime.  It was warm and I probably should have sent it back.  I left it sitting the entire time we were there.  The bartender was busy and on her cell phone most of the time, and I don't think that a re-make would have worked.  No follow up to see if our meals were alright or would we want dessert.  The plus side was being seated right away, but we waited and waited and waited for the check.  All of the waiting gave us plenty of time to notice that they are letting this place get dirtier and dirtier.  God only knows what the kitchen looks like.  We are not the kind of people that ever complain but...................We're done.  Not coming back.  You guys did put this location in the "White Harlem",  But we really picked up on the Vibe that you hate us.
