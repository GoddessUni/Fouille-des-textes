Haaa! Another generic pizza joint.  What can I say? It's not dog food, it's edible but it's not great pizza either. Every pizza joint I go to I try their pan pizza because I like how there is no thick, doughy crust around the outside and all the cheese and toppings go right up to the edge. Plus, how the outside edge of the crust is light, brown and crispy just blows away most hand tossed pizzas that are thick and chewy. Anywho, the last two times I went there (only because my mom wanted to go there) the deep dish pizzas I ordered were fails. They were slightly under cooked hand tossed pizzas,  with the thick, doughy ring around the outside but sitting in a pan. Pan pizza impostors! I said nothing about it the first time I ordered it but couldn't contain myself the 2nd time around. I told the waitress I ordered a pan pizza and she said that is a pan pizza. I let her know that just because it's served in a pan doesn't mean it's a pan pizza and had to explain the difference to her, she was clueless but seemed appreciative. Thank god I talked my mom into not going there any more. Now we go to East Coast Pizza in Riverside instead. What a world of difference!
