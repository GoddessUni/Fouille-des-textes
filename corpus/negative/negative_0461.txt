I want to start by saying that I love chipotle. I mean I have been eating it for years frequently. I've lived in multiple cities, eaten at multiple chipotles, and I have to say, this is, by far, the worst chipotle I have ever been to.

I don't think you could try to be worse than they are right now. A team of 6 year olds could service better than the staff they have. I have waited for 30 minutes countless times and dealt with the most incompetent humans ever. I don't know if that was the criteria to work at this chipotle.

They have ruined chipotle for me and it is really sad.
