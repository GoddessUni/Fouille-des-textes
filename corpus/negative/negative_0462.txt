I have gotten this sandy bottomed pizza a few times mainly because it's so cheap. Oddest thing about it is each time I have picked it up piping hot at the store it's cold by time I get home and I live less than 10 minutes from place. (One time it was 95 degrees out and I didn't run AC in car and it still happened.) It's probably due to thinness, but odd - never experienced anything like that with other pizza . Otherwise, pizza is far from memorable which is why I give it only two stars. Maybe worth a 2.5 because of cheap price.
