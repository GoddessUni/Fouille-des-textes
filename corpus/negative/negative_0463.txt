After a long night of boozing, I had the Golden Arches on my mind.  I thought about the crispy, but soft crunch of a fried greasy hash brown so much that I could taste it.  Finally, it was 5:00 AM and I thought this location was open as it said on its website and I placed an embarrassingly large order through the app to hide my identity.   I showed up around 5:15 AM, but the location was not open and Ronald was no where In sight. I tried to think of positives, such as not eating twice the appropriate daily caloric intake before 6 am.  However, I also thought of all the great men In history such as Warren Buffet who start there day with McDonald's.  It's the American way. Rockefeller, Carnegie, Lincoln, Jobs and Zuckerberg could always count on McDonald's. I am concerned on the  direction of this country and McDonald's is to blame. Needless to say, America really does run in Dunkin.
