I noticed that I had a 50% off any one pizza from my IMOS Customer Rewards. I ordered a 12", 2 topping pizza $13.25 for $6.63, a large salad

Ordered at 7:06 PM
Delivered at 8:10 PM

Before I go on; let me just say that having to PRE TIP for all Pizza Companies (Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Domino's, IMOS) due to the No Contact is stupid for the reason below! Most companies ask that you click 10%, 15%, 25% or to enter a dollar amount, prior to clicking the payment button.

I put the salad in the frig and went to open the pizza box which was cold. The pizza was lukewarm. I went to eat the first slice unfolded and the crust tasted raw and chewy. I tried one more piece and the same. I called the store.

The employee who answered asked what my last name was but had difficulty locating the order. I told her what I had and then I saw the ticket number: 89. She located the order number and said she would get the manager. I talked with Chris. I asked if she already explained what occurred with my order--"She said it was chewy." I said, the box was cold and the pizza lukewarm and was not edible. I tried 2 pieces but that was it.

I said I did not know if I was like the 5th on the delivery route but the order was placed an hour ago. The manager mumbled something about it should have only taken 30 minutes. I pressed that it was an hour. 

--Manager: It can't be undercooked because it runs on a conveyor belt. Do you want me to replace it?
--Me: Yes.
--Manager: Well, we are now running about an hour and a half wait at this time.
--Me: That's fine, I have a salad for now (which was to be my lunch tomorrow)
--Manager: Do you still have the pizza?
--Me: Yes 
--Manager: You will need to swap out the pizzas. 
--Me: Ok

At this time, I was like, I get that they are busy with other customers but all they did was offer me a replacement pizza and oh, by the way, it will be delivered around 9 PM (2-hours from my original order). WoW. Talk about great customer service.

I was watching TV but kept checking the front door every time I heard the door to my apartment building open (I am on the first floor). Nope. My phone was in the other room charging so I lost track of time while watching TV. I went to check my phone and it was now 10:45 PM. Two and half hours since I talked with the manager. Being they were delivering until 1 AM, I called back.

--Me: This is Mr. B..... I talked with you around 8:15. You were sending me a replacement pizza and you said you were running about 90 minutes but it has now been 2 1/2 hours.
--Manager: Oh, right. I went to ask the employee you talked with about the order and she said number "98" and that doesn't fit the order because I remember you said you had a salad and no salad on this order."
Me
--When he said 98, I cut him off and stated "Order Number 89."
Meanwhile, I am thinking, why didn't they call me back about a delay.
--Me: I don't have any missed calls or voicemails from the store
--Manager: That's because we don't have Caller-ID and I went through all of the orders but didn't find it so I couldn't call you back.

Now, I know what you're thinking-- the same as me; What Pizza company doesn't have Caller-ID, especially a company that has hundreds of locations and has been in business for 56-years (I checked) and how did my order mysteriously vanish?

--Manager: Do you still want your food?
-- Me: Yes (I didn't eat the salad)
--Manager: Are you sure because it will be about--I'll tell you what, the next time you order a pizza, just ask for Chris Wilson. Like Dennis the Menace. It will help you remember. (Oh sure, because I typically think of Dennis the Menace when trying to remember a person's name???); just ask for me and say that the pizza was chewy because nobody has ever complained about their pizza being chewy and I will remember; (Now, let's see if you guessed the same as me that he was about to offer me a free pizza--nope!)...and I will try and get you the best coupon available...

I thought to myself, are you freaking kidding me??? 

-- Me: Can you just refund me this order?
-- Manager: I will do you one better; what if instead, I give you a $15 store credit. (Me thinking, oh sure; like I am going to EVER order from his location again!!)
--Me: No. I will just take the refund.
--Manager: (chuckles): are you sure--because you only paid about $6 with your coupon and I am offering you a $15 store credit.
--Me: No thanks. I will take my refund

Meanwhile, I heard him adding up my subtotal and subtracting my $6.62 discount and what I paid for only the pizza of $6.63.

--Manager: Ok, so that changes your total payment to $16.89. (more chuckles). Is there anything else?
--Me: Do you need my credit card?
--Manager: No. It will offset.
