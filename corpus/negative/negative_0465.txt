Do I HAVE to give this garbage establishment a star?  It deserves none.

Not sure why I decided to order from Domino's in the first place, but I wanted some boneless chicken and it was the only place open for delivery.  I ordered online, which should omit human error in taking the order, but unfortunately it seems to be that Domino's employees cannot read, so I probably would have been better off calling to order.  Anyways....

My food arrived, driver assured me that all my sauces were in the box, and he ran off to his car.  I open the box and 1/2 my sauces (which you have to pay additional money for..) were missing.  Normally, I wouldn't care, but I ordered just for my chicken and I wanted my chicken with my sauce so I called and told them.

About 2 hours after placing the order, I finally received my sauces but by that point in time my chicken was cold.  

Additionally, pizza tastes like crap.  I will NEVER order from any Domino's location again, EVER.

There are literate people who need jobs that could do a 300% better job, not to mention Domino's food is just NASTY overall.  Horrible, horrible experience.  NEVER EVER  AGAIN. even in desperate times, I would rather starve.

Ugh.
