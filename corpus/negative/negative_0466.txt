I placed an order here a while ago for delivery and they forgot my onions on my salad. I called back and the manager hung up on me and refused to redeliver the correct salad. I came into the location for a refund and had to argue with the manager to get my money back! I used my reward last night for my free pizza for a carryout as this was the only location still opened. The other manager there refused to let me pick up my food and said she would only deliver to my old address. I said okay well deliver it there and I will meet driver. Then she said she couldn't deliver my food. Manager Neil tried to make it better and said come today to get my food and he will make it... I get up here and the same piece of shit manager from before refused to make my food because of his original mistake!! Their store owner Tony Martin sent me an email for a free pizza as well and this disrespectful ass manager will not honor it! I will not get IMOS anymore!! Horrible customer service!!!!! Would give no stars for this location if I could.
