We are repeat Gearo's customers and have been going for years - back to when they had a second location down Bustleton Avenue. They're generally good for dine-in. Their pizzas are good, their fried mozzarella is excellent, and their cheesesteaks are some of the best. But for delivery, they completely phone it in. It's like they bank on people not calling them out on how much they suck. I just spent $65 on a meal for my family. We had numerous missing items and the pasta dishes taste terrible - no seasoning or flavor. There were meatballs mixed in the "tomato sauce" for the chicken parm. What if we weren't meat eaters? These are egregious errors that I think border on reportable. 30 minutes later, I'm still waiting on the missing items and our food is cold.
