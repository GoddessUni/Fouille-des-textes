Stopped in with my wife and mom - wife's food was gross, mine was average and my mom's was good - not a great collective score. The place is filthy dirty, water on the floors and they keep the dirty dish tray right in the center of the restaurant where you hear clanging dishes while you eat. Furthermore, one of the waiters was walking around openly singing loudly where at one point we just had to shake our heads and laugh about the craziness!

We only stopped in out of ease driving through the town but I can guarantee you that none of us would ever try again (and especially at $50 for three meals on the lunch specials menu).
