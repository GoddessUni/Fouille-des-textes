I'm actually really sad to write this update...I had extremely high hopes for this place to do nothing but thrive....unfortunately I feel it did the exact opposite.  When I ate here for the first time in 2016, I meant what I said when I stated it was the best sushi in town. I sadly no longer feel that way. I feel like the service (always sooo slow, even when no one is there) and more importantly,  the quality of the fish is no longer top notch. In my opinion, it has been progressively declining, and for that reason I've been getting sushi elsewhere. Again, it saddens me to write this review, and I really like Victor, but I have to tell the truth...and this is the truth.
