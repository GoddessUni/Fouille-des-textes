2 stars because it was a slightly less then average experience. 
Walking in the smell of dusty antiques was slightly off putting but we had high hopes for this French cafe. The servers seemed nice enough but not very organized and very very slow. 
I ordered breakfast and asked to add a side of fruit because looking at the pictures the fruit salad looked good! The waitress said, "you want the breakfast AND fruit? All of that for you?"...Yes, don't judge me lady just bring me fruit! 
Food comes out at least 30 minutes later. The person who bring it says did some one ask for fruit? "Yes, thats mine" she says, "oh all of its yours?"...YES! Ok so I have a bad habit of ordering whatever I want to taste everything I saw on Yelp but then only eating half of it but seems like you should be happy for the sale instead of so surprised someone wants fruit. 
Eggs were overcooked and dried out. Sausage links are actually smoked sausage which was good but seems like it should warn you on the menu. Toast served dry and burnt. It was ok, not super impressive but not bad. Until I tried the fruit and it had an eggshell in it! Yuck! Did I accidently order a side of salmonella? Were they just that upset to have to serve fruit or that careless with everything? Then when it came time to pay she was gone for 20 minutes with our credit cards. When she came back she admitted she really didn't know how to use the credit card machine. If you come, bring cash!
