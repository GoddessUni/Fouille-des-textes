Went with the guys on a Friday night after some Villanova basketball. Just a couple of beers. Service was friendly and an OK crowd. Considering they are charging $7 for a pint of local craft beer, there is some work to be done. I would be more than happy to pay more for a great beer. Paying this much for a Victory Fest or Troegs Hopback that had to be poured 3 times due to the draft system being sub par doesn't cut it for me. If you are charging premium prices, get your system up to snuff. We  didn't eat, so I can not comment on the restaurant. Many of our friends enjoy it.
