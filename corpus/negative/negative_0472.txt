This is a review of the food. Went there last night for my 40th. Party of 9. The iceberg on my wedge salad was rubbery, obviously old product. The two cherry tomatoes were BOTH rotten. I'm serious. That was my first round. The fried shrimp platter came and my French fries were literally cold and my shrimp were warm but not hot. My cousin had surf and turf with steak and shrimp and said his shrimp were fishy tasting (not fresh) and his steak was chewy despite it being a filet. My other cousin had the pasta with fried soft shell crab and said her pasta was cold. My uncle had the ribeye and said his steak was cold. 

The manager took care of the problems by not charging for something I didn't eat, but after two strikes, I was not willing to wait for more disappointment. 

Just an utterly disappointing birthday dinner. 

This place = Never again for me.
