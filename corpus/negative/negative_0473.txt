Wow, has this place gone downhill rapidly.  From the apparent change in personnel, I'm guessing it's been sold (again... first from Stonehouse Q to the Slow and Low food truck guys to now this new management).  I ordered the brisket on a recommendation from a neighborhood listserv - big mistake.  The brisket was terrible - poor quality, incredibly fatty, tasteless - like canned food.  The sides were equally bad.  They were also completely disorganized and had little idea how to get the food out in an orderly fashion from cashier to kitchen to table.

It's really unfortunate because the Stonehouse Q guys were actually pretty good, and their smoked chicken was phenomenal.  The Slow and Low food truck guys were also decent, but it's been a rapid decline from owner to owner to owner.  The hidden location and build-out are just really hard to overcome, and it doesn't help if no one ever finds out about your eatery, whether through marketing or foot traffic or word of mouth.

Our experience was somewhat ironic considering while we were eating they had a reality TV show on that featured a restaurant management scenario.
