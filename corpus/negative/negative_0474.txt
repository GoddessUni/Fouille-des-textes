Today was my first ever trip to 2 Fat Guys.  Heard some good things about it so I was anxious to eat there for lunch.  Walked in and was seated promptly.  There was only one other table with people.  Ashley was our waitress.  She took our drink order and they came out promptly.  She then took our food order.  I had the classic cheeseburger, medium.  I noticed on the menu it says that it comes with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickles.  I requested no tomato and no pickles and asked for a side of mayo.  She wrote it down and read it back to me verbatim.  When I got my burger, there was no lettuce, no onions and no pickles, but there was a slice of tomato.  No side of mayo either.  I had to call her back to the table to ask for the side of mayo, which she brought out (no apology for not bringing it out originally).  Burger was more medium rare than medium, but not a big deal.  Had to wait quite a while to get a drink refill - my soda was just about empty when she brought out my burger and I finished my meal and waited close to 10 minutes before she came back to the table (to bring the bill, not to check on us).  If the place was packed, I could excuse these small items that were not done correctly, but there were only two tables with customers.  Burger was OK, nothing I'd tell anybody about, but the mess up with the toppings on my burger and the lack of checking on us periodically are just things that shouldn't happen when it's so slow in a restaurant.
