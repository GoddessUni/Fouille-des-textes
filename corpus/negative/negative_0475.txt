I don't even know where to begin. I have lived all over the US and eaten in restaurants in just about every major city, and I have never had such an awful experience. If I could give this review negative stars, it would have them. We were a party of six. Restaurant had customers, but no where near capacity. No one acknowledged us. After about ten minutes, the bartender acknowledged us and brought us drinks. Still no server in sight. Both of my daughters are servers, and believe me I know how restaurants work, and clearly no one at the Peacock has a clue. There didn't seem to be any assigned tables...waitstaff was wandering around, some obviously had no idea what they were supposed to be doing. Now to the food. Three of the party had burgers. These were perhaps the worst burgers ever served. One of my party said it tasted like it had been boiled. Another ordered the shrimp po boy. The "Asian slaw" had no dressing...it was just plain cabbage, with some lettuce thrown in. Maybe 5 tiny fried shrimp, and they were cold. My tuna wasabi melt had no wasabi, and it was also cold. The 6th member of our party walked out when she was told her soup would take an additional half hour. The only kudos were to the bartender, who seemed to be working in what I can only describe as a cacophony of chaos. This restaurant was clearly no where near ready to open. The cooks do not know the menu (and the menu isn't that big!), the servers have clearly never served anywhere in their lives. This place should be hopping, and it was an abysmal experience from the moment we walked in. The decor is fabulous. Joe Edwards, you need to fire your manager, as he/she clearly is completely inadequate to this task. Hire someone who has actually managed a restaurant before!
