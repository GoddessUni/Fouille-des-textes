DO NOT PLAN ON USING YOUR GIFT CARD. We went out of our way to use a gift card that was provided to us for Christmas and were informed at the time of payment that the gift card was not good for two more days and they were sure the message was relayed to the person who purchased as a gift for us.  This was a slimy way to pull us back in for more money in the future and was quite frustrating, especially due to the holiday season and nature of our visit.  The salmon and server were great but we found it quite ridiculous that the general manager couldn't reduce the bill and take our gift card.  We won't be back and suggest all check to ensure gift cards will work before using them.. a nice night out turned into one worth venting about..
