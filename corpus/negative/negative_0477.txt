I ordered the chicken salad sandwich.  After about 5 minutes one of the workers asked me what kind of bagel I wanted it on.  I replied Asiago.  He  said they didn't have that.  So I had to walk back in line to see what they had.  I was the only one in line when I got there.  I watched as 2 guys kept looking at the order screen and then started some other random work.  after a good 10+ minutes they gave me my order.  It was dry, maybe 10 chunks of chicken, then it totally fell apart when I tried to eat it.  NOT worth the $8.00
