Placed an order online here with Yelp and was extremely dissapointed. Yelp screwed up so the order was already delayed. After waiting for an extra 15 minutes at the restaurant, we saw they were missing one of the meals we ordered. Without even a small apology, we waited another 15 minutes. The excuse that came out of the employees mouth was "the oven was off". There wasn't even napkins, utensils, or anything that a take out order should have in the bag. The place was in shambles and I wouldn't be surprised if it closed down soon. The food was alright, but in no way worth it after that terrible service.
