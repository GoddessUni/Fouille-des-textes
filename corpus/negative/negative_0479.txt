Soooo...i went for the first time last week for my birthday. I was super stoked after reading the reviews and watching the pictures on Yelp....

Ambiance: very quaint and intimate which i loved. There are probably only 8 tables in the restaurant so i would call ahead just to get an idea about wait times. I went on a Thursday evening around 6.30pm and there was no wait time. 

Food: this was the problem for me...oh how i wish it weren't so. We had the Sake pulled pork buns (which was delicious!!!) but when it came to the ramen (Tan Tan Men)...that fell flat for me personally. I did not like the flavor...it was too bitter!!! I had no problem with the simplicity of the dish but i really couldn't get over the flavor palate. If only I could erase the flavor from my tastebuds! My husband and I were truly disappointed. I can't talk for anything else on the menu but i will surely not have that ramen ever again.
