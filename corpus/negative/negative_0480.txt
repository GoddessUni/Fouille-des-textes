Slow service?  Try NO service.
Was here on a weeknight, it wasn't terribly busy or anything with maybe a third of the seats full.  Sat down waited a few minutes for anyone to come over.  Finally after a good 5 minute a waitress asked what I wanted and gave me a menu. I ordered a beer and said I'll need a few minutes to decide what I'll eat.  And that was it.  That was my entire experience.  Never got my beer, waitress never came back to take my food order and I sat there completely ignored.  Left and went to Chuck Lager instead.
