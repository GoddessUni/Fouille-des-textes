Maybe it was on off night...maybe they were short staffed. Took 1/2 hour to get a drink and then had to ask server for one. They did not have the wine or the beer we asked for as they said they had 1200 people event two days before and were out of a lot of things. The place is beautiful and well done. The food was good. The service was very very sub par. Waiting for the check they came up and said they NOW had the wine I was looking for. IT JUST CAME IN. Thanks....little too late. No apologies. The Cosmo glass only half full and not the best. Little pricey I thought and I normally don't care about the numbers...Just not a great dining experience....
