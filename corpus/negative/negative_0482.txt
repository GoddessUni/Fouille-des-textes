We were in the middle of discussing catering menu and price point. After several lovely conversations and a taste testing everything went downhill. 
We wanted to change our choices based on a diverse group. Sent several emails asking to price and taste pasta dishes. Requested a taste testing for a bowl of pasta and a couple of sauces, and Angie quoted a price of $50 for a bowl of pasta. We were not charged for the first tasting per industry standard but she accepted a $20 tip. $50 for a bowl of pasta tasting is outrageous. Needless to say we'll take our $4,000 budget somewhere else. Very poor business practice.
