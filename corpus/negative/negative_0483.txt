I never write reviews. I NEVER  do this but i'm infuriated at the level of service from this Applebee's Restaurant. I have been in Arizona for 9 of my 30 years and have been to just about every Applebee's (Wetmore, Grant, Park Place etc) multiple times and have NEVER been treated or had my family treated the way we were this evening. It was not at all busy in the restaurant for it being Game 1 of the NBA finals. We were seated and I will say that was quick and at FIRST the host was friendly, however she made a weird comment about her 8 year old grandson dating my 3 year old daughter in the future. "I bet he'd like her she's pretty"....Unacceptable! 
 
Our waiter/server, Forrest, did not introduce himself and asked if we were ready to order drinks but did not offer appetizers or advise us that we could order our own appetizers through the kiosk. He instead took the time to bus a table behind us. Being efficient? Ok. He passed us for a table in front of us this time as they were getting ready to leave. That's when my wife had to ask him if we could order appetizers, at which point he walked back to our table and tapped on the kiosk with his finger. He was friendly with the table in front of us as they were leaving. Passes us several times before finally bringing us our drinks. We were still looking at entrees and advised him of that. Not once did he come back to check and see if we wanted to order. Instead, a table that got seated in front of us, got their drink orders put in. He passed us several more times as he brought them their wines and other drinks and proceeded to talk with them. Again, not once did he stop at our table to see if we wanted to order. My wife, daughter and I sat there for 30 minutes and never saw our appetizers even hit the table. Forrest for some reason didn't seem too thrilled to be serving us. I've never been so upset by the treatment of a restaurant. 

Normally when we eat here we have no issues. Not sure what's going on but the lack in customer service on a non busy night is super disappointing. Told Management on the way out. Management didn't offer anything at the time or apologize. I had time to notice everything mentioned because we were not being served. 

*At one point I asked them to change ONE TV to the game because they were all on a spelling bee. Forrest went to talk to the Manager and half of the TV's changed. Not sure if that upset anyone or what the case may be. Might not be a loss to them that we won't return but hopefully this review helps this to not happen again.

**My family and I drove to Buffalo Wild Wings and Fox and Hound but they were all packed. We decided on Applebee's because they were not packed. We had to settle for fast food due to it being late and our daughter being irritable at that point. Myself as well. 

***I am African American, my wife is hispanic and my daughter is mixed. I hope and pray race had nothing to do with it but Forrest being Caucasian, sure was talkative and friendly to the table before and while we were there, who also happened to be Caucasian families. Again, didn't speak with us outside of the mentioned above.
