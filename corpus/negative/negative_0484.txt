I am giving this place two stars only because our server was a sweetheart. The food was really just awful. My hubby ordered the falafel platter w hummus. The hummus was almost white and tasted like plain yogurt. The falafel looked good but tasted like bread. Next he ordered the chicken shwarma and when he picked it up oil ran out the bottom and covered the whole plate below. The one bright spot was that the french fries were good. My daughter ordered the garden pizza when it was put on the table we immediately noticed there was something crawling across the top that then sunk into the cheese. The server looked and was able to see whatever it was squirming around and took it back to have another prepared. When the garden pizza finally arrived for the second time we noticed that we couldn't really make out the variety of veggies on the pizza because it was almost completely covered with black olives. It was not good. Lastly I ordered the smoke salmon on pita. I was thinking it would be like bagels and lox but instead on pita . Lets just say I was wrong and it was weird. This place is in a great location and has outdoor seating. It looks like it would be a nice place to hangout but I just don't know what you could eat there
