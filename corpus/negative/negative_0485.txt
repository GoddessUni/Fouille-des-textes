I've been a fan of this restaurant in the past, and I have a personal commitment to support restaurants that pursue Mexican cuisine. But a return visit to Plaza Azteca Exton this past weekend was an utter disaster.

The food was good enough, and our party of 7 much enjoyed a good meal in celebration of the pending return of a family member to his native South America. But near the conclusion of our visit, matters went badly awry. We discovered that the floor between the dining area and restrooms was quite slick with some oily substance. I managed to avoid a fall, but my long suffering wife was not so fortunate. She took a rather bad spill.

But it got worse. During a visit to the restroom I watched in shock as one of the liveried staff flushed the toilet, exited the stall and left the bathroom -- without stopping to wash his hands. Such things shatter confidence. I really doubt we'll return. But they're such simple problems to avoid.

I posted this message privately to the restaurant's Facebook page, but received no reply. And so I must post it to this more public forum.

Your restaurant has promise. Please don't continue to betray it with poor attention to safety and hygiene. Train your staff properly and be vigilant. Be respectful of your clientele and you may yet prosper.
