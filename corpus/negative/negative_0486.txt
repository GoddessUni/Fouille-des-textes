I like the pizza here but i just was part of false advertisement. The flyer says "get a free soda" when you purchase online for the first you get a free soda. It was my first time purchasing online and I was told that I don't qualify for a soda but that I can get a coupon... they told me that i have to put that online and I said that the next time i order it wont be the first time anymore and they said "I dont know what to tell you". The whole time I remained calm but i was truly pretty mad. I also did not see anywhere in the advertisement that the free soda had to be inputed online when you place your order. I truly like this pizza but that was unacceptable. I am happy to remove this post if they make it right. Find me as Mariano
