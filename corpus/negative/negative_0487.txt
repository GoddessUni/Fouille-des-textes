This location is absolutely the worst! A few weeks ago I went through drive thru at 8:30pm to order grilled chicken breast platters and was told that they had no chicken? Huh you are a chicken restaurant. Stopped by the drive thru today 6/8/2021 at 11:30 am and ordered lunch. After paying at window, I was asked to pull up to the corner by the door and my food would be brought out to me. After waiting there for about 10 minutes a gentlemen comes out and says I can not park we're I was at. When I said the girl told me to pull there he then said no, pull to the front door and park. I did so and he brings my food out minus the chicken pinchos I ordered saying that They would take to long to make. Ask me did I want my money back and I said yes. Then I ask why they are having so many issues with getting people there orders, he said it was none of my business and again ask me did I want my money back. I said no, keep the money and use it to hire better staff. I will not visit this location ever again and I will share my experience with all my neighbors, family, and grit!!!!
