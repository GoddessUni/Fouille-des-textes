This is the second time I have been to Carino's. The first time was in Northern California which should have taught me to avoid all of their locations...we waited 20 minutes to be served, and 45 minutes for our food while all the employees were having a 'gab fest' in the kitchen...but foolish me, I thought maybe the Reno Carino's would be better, unfortunately I was wrong... Service was just awful. The waitress was clearly distracted, she never made eye contact with us and had to ask us to repeat our order three times.  We got a 'brunch special' using an online coupon. The food was served in a dish that was about 4" x 6".  In other words, for around $8 each we got a little more than a saucer full of bland unattractive food, and it was served without the only thing that is really good at Carino's their bread....  How places like this stay in business is just astounding.
