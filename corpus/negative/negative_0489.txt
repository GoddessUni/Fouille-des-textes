A friend and mine were going to have lunch here and parked in their lot which had no parking signs posted but had small print. We noticed small print on the top of the sign so started walking towards the sign to read what the small print said. As we were reading it which said Dolce Vita parking only - a man in a white apron came out of the side door and started yelling at us stating 'You can not park in this lot. But go ahead and park there and I'll have you towed' I am assuming the man thought we were going to be going to the restaurant across the street that seemed to be getting more business? But my friend and I just wanted a slice of pizza for lunch and were immediately yelled at by a man that may have even been the owner. Business lost - VERY RUDE.
