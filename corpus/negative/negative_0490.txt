My daughter wanted to try this place so we walked up to an empty counter and waited. Finally, a guy walks out with AirPods in and doesn't even speak to us, just has his head down like he's listening to something. Then a group of late teens walk up and order while we just stand there.. after we watch the guy make the drink without speaking, he hands it over to the teens and then looks at me. Doesn't say ANYTHING. Just looks at me.  I ordered the Oreo Wonderland that my daughter wanted. He rang it up and mumbled my $8 total and I paid.  This guy seriously made the order without speaking the entire time and simply handed it to my daughter when he was finished STILL SAYING NOTHING.  It was a weird experience. My daughter enjoyed the treat but I would never come here again.
