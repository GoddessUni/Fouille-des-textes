day after Christmas last week took the family (3 grown kids, wife, 85 year old mother in law) for a late lunch. cannot and will not go back ever. i don't like leaving bad reviews, and i don't review much, but hopefully this helps mgmt refine their act.

drinks and guac came out quickly and nicely. then after 10-12 min (im a timer) two of our entrees were delivered.  they were salads. i asked why don't you bring them all out at one time, and got unintelligible platitudes that were designed for kitchen's benefit, not customers'. then, 15 minutes after this, our tacos came out. oh. sorry. not exactly right. grandma's pitiful little cheese quesadilla did come out. then ours, several minutes later.  grandmas's lunch looked like a very poor prison lunch. one quesadilla on wax paper, on an aluminum tray.

the coup de grace is when the (nice enough) manager brought all our tacos on one  same type of aluminum tray, and "here you go!"---like we are supposed to know what is what. i wouldn't think this would work even for regular patrons.

possibly the C team was working day after Christmas, but the place was full, so i would think they'd engineer around that.

also, way expensive for what we had. portions laughably small.
