Don't waste your time!  We have been to The Egg and I a few times, but this one took the cake. No host, no busser, dirty tables, overflowing toilet and a 30 minute ticket time when there were only 4 other tables in the whole restaurant. Food is fine, but the restaurant itself is a disorganized, dirty mess. When we told the manager she apologized and said she had just arrived, although I watched her walk through the restaurant for the entire time we were there. There are plenty of other places in Carmel that are appropriately staffed and we will spend our money elsewhere from now on.
