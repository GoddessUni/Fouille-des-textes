Overrated.  About 90% of the things sold here you can get around the corner from your house at the local grocers.  I was there Sat.  Very crowded.  People stepping on each other's toes.
  
Bassetts ice cream is very commercialized and run like the the local Wendy's, and not all it was cracked up to be.  This one of the reasons I chose to visit was because of all the hoopla I heard about Bassett's.  Two baby scoops of ice cream for $5.  Braums ice cream that I used to visit was 10x's better and much cheaper.  Ben and Jerry's tastes even better than this.  
 
Much of the cooked food here is over priced and underseasoned.  It reminded me of an upgraded mall Food Court.  

Parking was $8 for 2 hrs.  Driving around RTM is typical horrendous  hectic downtown driving.   

One of the few places that I did like was Herschels East side deli.  The roast and corned beef were worth the price, very tender and moist.  

At any rate, save yourself the hassle and gas.  Why fight your way thru a crowded food court for chicken, fish or ice cream when you can get that almost hassle free at the local grocers.  However, if you like crowds and ppl watching than this might be your thing.
