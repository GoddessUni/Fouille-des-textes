What kind of ice cream shop doesn't have hot fudge?!? Let me preface this with the fact that I am 5 months pregnant and have been craving a hot fudge sundae since day 1. This Baskin Robbins has not had hot fudge for over 3 months. They have been "out" of our fudge. I'm not sure if they're not reordering it, or just don't want to make a hot fudge sundae. But I'm pretty sure there's not a hot fudge shortage, and the fact that this is the 8th time I've tried pretty much seals the deal. Support another ice cream shop... there are plenty of other options here.
