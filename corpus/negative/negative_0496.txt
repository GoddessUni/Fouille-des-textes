I ordered online then showed up at 6:20 when they said my order was going to be ready. I checked in when I got there. Then I waited TWENTY minutes so we asked how long it will be and they then told us that they don't even have my order! It never printed on their end so I asked for a refund and they told me I have to do it through the app, then they wouldn't even tell me how! I the. Left and called to speak with a manager but the phones kept going straight to voicemail. On top of everything, the girl was soooooo rude to EVERYONEAbsolutely TERRIBLE service. 

Update: ordered Uber Eats tonight so we didn't have to deal with what we dealt with last time. We are missing an egg roll, the teriyaki sauce for the teriyaki chicken (which makes no sense) AND the sweet and sour sauce we specifically asked for!!! AND we asked for "lots of soy sauce" and they gave us 2 packs!!! And of course when I called the store they didn't answer. I don't even know why we try anymore.
