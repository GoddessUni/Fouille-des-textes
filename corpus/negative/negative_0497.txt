Never in my life have I had such an awful experience at a drive through. We literally sat in the drive through for 30 minutes and by the time we were so fed up with waiting, we couldn't leave because we were sandwiched between two cars. We waited another 10 minutes when we finally got to the order box. Nothing was said to us for at LEAST 10 minutes. There were cars behind us blowing their horns, either at me or they were honking at the restaurant. We all had waited an ridiculous amount of time. Finally, extremely quietly I heard a "hello?" And I said "Hi" and the cashier said "Hi," and after a very awkward absence of a follow up, I said "can I have a medium strawberry banana Orange Julius?" She said "we don't have that." So I said, "Can I have a Carmel Apple pie blizzard?" And after a few "I'm sorry I couldn't hear you's" because the speaker was so, so, so quiet, she said "I'm sorry, we don't have that." we pulled away, now both having wasted an hour of our time for two Items that we were really craving. This location is absolutely awful, it's almost funny. I'm really not surprised more and more DQ's are closing. The speed of this drive thru is absolutely insane.
