This past Saturday we took some friends to Buckley's for lunch. What a disappointment! After serving us drinks the waitress, who appeared to be very uninterested, took our lunch orders: our guests ordered the French dip and the crab cake sandwich, my girl friend ordered a hamburger and I got the fish and chips. Our food arrived a good twenty minutes later. The French dip looked as though it had been sitting under a heat lamp for, well, 20 minutes. My fish and chips arrived in a metal basket lined with wax paper. There was literally little puddles of grease in the bottom of the basket! The batter on the fish was a greasy mess and the fish was gray and mushy. This was actually the worst fish and chips I've ever had and could not finish it. I did not to say anything about my meal and was hoping the other meals were better; apparently not: I noticed only half the crab cake sandwich had been eaten. When we got home I asked my girl friend how her hamburger was and she said it was just okay. She also commented on how rude the waitress was. This place has so much potential but until it changes owners/manager/chef we will never return. What a shame!
