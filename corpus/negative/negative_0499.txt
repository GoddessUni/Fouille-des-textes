Went there for lunch today one many Yelper's recommendations.  I have to say that the gentleman who was behind the bar was friendly and helpful.  The platter came out in decent time. 

Where I feel Ben's falls way short is in the portion size.  I see all of these photos of piles of brisket.  Mine was Three small slices that look more like pot roast than brisket. The sandwiches the guys next to me ordered had more meat than my platter at 1/3 the price. The sides were tiny but I expected that from the photos.  The corn bread was the size of a silver dollar.

The food tasted OK.  By far not worth 5 stars.  $13.00 and I was still hungry when I left.  Charge me more but fill me up.
