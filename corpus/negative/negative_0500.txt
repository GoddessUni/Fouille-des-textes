Really rough day. Was looking forward to a cold beer and a hot meal. Chuy's is close to home so headed there. After ordering a large beer the bartender told me about the specials. Any burger/ any beer for $9.99. Turns out the "any beer" is a small beer. Mine didn't qualify but he said I could always order another. Would have been nice to tell me about the special beforehand.

I ordered a burger meal, medium well. 35 minutes later, I was still waiting for my burger. Noticed a few other burger meals pass through the food window. I was asked a couple times if I wanted another beer. I responded that I was waiting for my meal before ordering another beer. After being asked the third time I said that I would much prefer my burger over the beer. After checking on my order the employee told me that since I ordered my burger well done, it would be a few more minutes. I immediately told her that I ordered it medium well, not well done, and asked to skip the meal and just pay for the beer as I was tired of waiting. 

While she was ringing me up, I asked about a veteran's discount I overheard a few other customers get. She said they offer it, but since she already took off the mealI she could not discount my bill further. I believe the right thing to do would have been create a new ticket with a discounted drink, or comp the beer entirely for my extended wait. Doesn't matter, though as this is not my first negative experience at this restaurant so the easy choice is for me to not return as a customer. I keep thinking they will get better, but they don't and it is unfortunate because it really used to be a great restaurant to stop by to eat, drink, and hang out with friends.
