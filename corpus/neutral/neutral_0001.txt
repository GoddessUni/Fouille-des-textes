In town for a couple of days and I figured I should see what the hype was about.  Hopefully at some point I'll be back when I manage to taste their signature dishes...

I'm not a fan of the business model where they only have a set amount of food and sell out by 8 pm.  We arrived at around 7 and they were out of beef brisket!  Sad face.  Ok, 25 racks of ribs left, and I'm way back at the end of the line next to the door in the back.  I was devastated as I watched the painful countdown 20, 17, 13, 10, 7, 5, 2... OUT while I was 2 customers away from the register.

I ended up with pulled pork, pulled chicken, sweet potato fries, and fried corn on the cob.  Sigh, I had such high expectations.  Everything was ok, it's just that I don't like having to slather everything in sauce to enjoy something.  Out of the three sauces (Original, Sweet Baby Jane & Spicy), Sweet Baby Jane was my favorite.  My coworker even bought a bottle to bring back to Cali with us.

The sweet potato fries were really excellent.  The fried corn on the cob was... interesting.  It was fried, but surprisingly squishy and really salty and buttery.
