Check it. This place is pretty good. Its consistent, and that's got to count for something. They have good drink specials many nights, decent food (I think its just as good as some of the other joints on the street) and its got a few different vibes. They've got an upstairs jawn with a dj playing every now and again, they've got a downstairs jawn with a big TV for you Phillies or Eagles fans, and they've got the outdoor area dubbed the "Oasis". I am saying. It is a true Oasis. You've got to see it for yourself.

The service is pretty slow. If you've eaten at any other Ethiopian restaurant, this should be expected.
