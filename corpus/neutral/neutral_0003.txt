The food was great, my margarita was great, and the ambiance is great.  However, the service was a little lacking and maybe just because it was a Saturday night.  While our food came out within 20 minutes, we sat there without the usual chips and salsa while everyone seated around us got theirs.  We finally had to ask for our chips and salsa when they brought our food out.  My fajitas were still fantastic and they are reasonably priced, but I was very disappointed that they forgot the chips and salsa.  This is the first time I have been to this location and would go back again.  Maybe the next time their service will earn them more stars!
