This is my favorite Starbucks ever thanks to the barista (her name starts with a C, I believe) who made my drink, a double shot on ice, perfectly and without a second thought or even an eye roll. She seemed happy to be there! The manager at the counter, however, named Jeff, was absolutely rude to me. He acted visibly annoyed with me while taking my order, and had a mocking tone to his voice. I could tell he didn't want to "deal" with me. I was polite as can be but he definitely woke up on the wrong side of the bed. Seems to me like the barista and manager should switch positions. She is much more customer friendly than he is and served me with sweet hospitality and a warm smile. She is the only reason I will return.
