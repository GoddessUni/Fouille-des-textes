I'm new to this spot. They have a decent menu.
Inside the place looks surprisingly clean and kept in order.

I ordered half a chicken and boneless chicken. I was disappointed to arrive and pick up only a half chicken -- they were out of boneless chicken I was told. I was only frustrated due to thier lack of reaching out to allow me to change my order. He asks if I still wanted the half chicken when I arrived and I said only if its ready. He said It was and collected my money. Then I waited 10mimutes (while he deep fried a chicken)

If you ever have a group of people they have a nice big round table, seats at least 8 people.
