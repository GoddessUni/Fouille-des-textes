If you want the best treatment for your animal child you may find yourself here one day.
Be sure to know just how much you still have left on your mortgage and whether you want to take a vacation anytime soon.
All the people are professional and polite as they can be with 20 other people and animals coming and going within a 15 minute wait time in the lobby.
They must have an army of people working there and that's why it is so expensive.
BUT.................be aware that whatever they quote you as an estimate will most likely double by the time you pick up your child.
Dr. Sadanaga is very good at what he does.  

But our dog got an awful fungal infection in his sinus cavity.
Fungal Rhinitis...............luckily our personal vet described what the procedure was going to be or I'd have had a breakdown when we went to pick up our dog after the FIRST operation.

I suggest you think twice about torturing your dog if they get this fungal disease.
Not only did we do this to our dog once,,,,,,,,,,,,,,but the fungus did not go away completely so we did it all over again.
It is now almost 2 months after all the procedures and our dog is is alive, running around and is my husbands' constant companion.  They both are happy and I'm glad they are both still with me.  I'd say I'm glad the dog is still with us, but that might make you think I prefer the dog over my husband.  Hmmmm?

Some people think there is a price limit  on what you spend on taking care of your animal child.  In this case it was a matter of 6-9 months of living with nose wiping, hott and cold compresses.  Snot/blood  all over the floor, walls, carpet and clothing.  Try to shove bullet size pills down your dogs' throat.   Our house was covered ever inch with a blanket or towel.  Laundry was done once or twice a day.
If you have children or any other animals--if you have a job or other responsibilities--- drop me a line before you have treatment.
It was awful.
