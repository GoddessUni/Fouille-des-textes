Took a cooking class here with Betty Foo (sister of more famous Susannah) 2 years ago.  Entire family who work in the restaurant are very nice.  The interior is warm and cozy.  This is not your average chinese food place.  

A little on the pricey side for what you get, but great anyway.  That's what you get if you are in ritzy Ardmore, anyway.   Good for large parties because they have large round tables.  Great service.  

I learned to make a mean hot and sour soup and to get the best soy sauce ever (Kimlan).  Right between the  Ardmore Police Department and train station.  Easy to miss.
