Michael's Cafe just closed down. Their last day was Saturday, 05/27/2017. I hadn't been there in quite some time but it is sad to know that they closed after 20+ years. I believe this happened because first they hired a new manager who I heard was not really on the up & up. Secondly, they started charging $5.00, Thirdly, Parx Casino 360 Club took away most of their clientele & the crowd at Michael's lessened a lot. It was a good place to go to on a Saturday if you were bored & wanted to dance and observe the people. Sorry to see it go. Wish I was able to buy that place and make it into a 70's, 80's & 90's type of retro club. Goodbye Michael's Cafe! I really had some fun times there.
