Vapor road It used to be blockbuster I don't know why they changed it but oh well. Let me first say that it's really expensive like Damn. I asked the lady i think her name was Kristen does she have anything under 20 dollars she said no I asked does she have anything in the 20 dollar range she said no. Like really almost everything in that store is 30 dollars and up if your a teen like me and don't have that kinda money I would recommend that you take your money online and buy a starter kit. I think every starter kit at vapor road is 30 dollars and over. Overall when you walk into the store it smells really good like I like to walk into that store. But Kristen in my opinion has a bad attitude. When I asked her was there anything under 20 dollars keep in mind I'm a beginner vapor and she looked at me with a weird face and shook her head no like Damn I dident know. If Kristen would change her attitude into somebody more friendly and like her job and the prices in vapor road would go down gradually vapor road would be the place to be.
