There's a lot of little things I like about Julio's.  The decor is nicely done, and certainly thematic, and the open-air front really opens the place up and gets a bit of a breeze going through.  I'd like to go back and see if I can secure a table at the front - I think with the Whyte Ave night life on a summer's night that would be fantastic.

The food really doesn't cover much in the way of local dishes beyond the well-known fare, which is a shame, but I enjoyed everything I ate.  Food portions were on the large side - so you shouldn't be leaving here hungry, and yet the price left me a bit sore.  $19.00 is a lot for a main dish of fajitas, even if they are nice!  Best surprise of my evening was fishbowl-sized margaritas.  Hurray!

The Fried Ice Cream is definitely worth a try.
