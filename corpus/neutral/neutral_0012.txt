Love the food of course, and I've came here multiple times. Today I decided to for breakfast alone, like yesterday. Only difference is that I waited at my table for LITERALLY 20 minutes before being served!!! I saw people coming in after me and having their orders taken immediately after sitting. I was told someone would come attend to me and here I was sitting for 20 minutes until I had to stop a nearby waitress and inform her of my long waiting time. She apologized and took my order soon after. I don't know if it was miscommunication with the staff or whatever, but I'm coming here to pay for good food AND GOOD SERVICE. I'm not the one to post reviews but this has to be said..
