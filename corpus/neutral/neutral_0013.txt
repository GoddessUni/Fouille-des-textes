Warm cookies delivered with good communication from driver and a friendly delivery experience. Nothing but compliments on the cookies but the marketing department is very unhonest and misleading the which makes you question the values of the company. If the company was honest in their marketing it would be 5 stars but when the marketing and store mislead you on purpose in their Facebook ads it makes you wonder why they are so desperate for business. Also for the person who will reply on Yelp you already gave me the oops we are sorry we will share your feedback answer when I worked with you directly which you know is really code word for your feedback went to the shredder especially since you still run the same ads.
