Barbuzzo is a trendy hot spot with good food and even better ambiance.  The place is decorated beautifully, which really struck me upon walking in.  There's a natural-earthy-woody feel there, barn-like doors/planks on the walls...It felt homey but also updated and very chic.

The food was good...though unfortunately being gluten free at Barbuzzo leaves something to be desired.  They can totally accommodate you if you're GF, but the pizzas and pastas looked nice and I'm sure they're great (just couldn't try any of them as GF pasta was not on-hand).  I really wanted this Arancini risotto on the menu, but was told that it's actually fried risotto balls and could not be made GF.  Bummer.  

On the other hand, we had some nice entrees to share.  The vegetable board featured 4 prepared veggie salads which were all unique and interesting to taste/try.  We then had the swordfish, short rib and octopus & calamari dish.  Swordfish was done perfectly - moist, steaky, with tomato pesto on top - delicious.  Short rib was good...could have been better (I love short ribs, I wanted more sauce on this).  The calamari was grilled, fresh, good...but nothing special.  

Definitely have a cocktail.  My date has basil lemonade (vodka, housemade lemonade, torn basil leaves), and I had the Sanguinello, which was blood orange deliciousness (ketel orange, blood orange puree, chambord, lime).  Our cocktails were great, and I could have easily had more, but then I would've been tanked. 

Prices are pretty reasonable for a place of this caliber in Center City.  The dishes are served family-style, but this is by no means a tapas portion.  2 dishes per person is PLENTY.  

Also note - if you don't eat pork, this may not be the place for you.  A lot of interesting dishes had tons of pork and/or lard and/or shellfish...not exactly kosher. :)
