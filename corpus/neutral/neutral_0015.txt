I was staying at a hotel not too far from here and when I looked up places nearby this restaurant came up. Parking was super easy and it wasn't super crowded on a Sunday. When we walked in there was no one there to take our name but a nice lady that was also waiting for a table told me to go around to the register and put my name down.
We waited about 10 minutes for a table which wasn't horrible. The waitress was very friendly and came over right away to take our drink orders. About five minutes later she was back to take our order and I noticed she wrote some of what we ordered but not everything. At first I just assumed she had great memory since some servers do but I was wrong when our order didn't come out as we wanted. 
We were too hungry to send it back and just ate it as it came. 
The food took a very long time to come out maybe about 20 mins which I find that to be very long for breakfast since most of the items cook rather quickly.
The food was okay a little bit blend for my taste, I never add salt to my food and I had to for this meal.
I do have to say the chicken fingers that came with my waffles were amazing and the bacon was super crispy :)
