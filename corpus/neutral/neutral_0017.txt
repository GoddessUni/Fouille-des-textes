TGI FRIDAYS meets Chucky Cheese meets El Sazon...and it ain't all bad

In spite of the fact that this place is chock-full of geeks from the burbs, and in spite of the fact that there are kids running around all over the place screaming, and in spite of the ever present herd of freeloaders sipping water and grazing on the free chips, and in spite of the fact that there is often a 30-45 minute wait - and in spite of the fact that the much heralded sauces are bland and uninspired...the beef fajita here is SO DAMN GOOD that  it makes it all worth while.
