Tried Dos Tacos for dinner tonight with the wife.  We went there hungry and ordered a large number of things to sample.  All-in-all, it was good.  Good food, good service, good price...but just good.

Chica Flaca Salad:  Good.  A good combination of flavors and nice texture.  The tofu was extremely salty though.

Ta-Korea Taco:  Again, it was good.  The steak didn't have the best texture to it as it was a little grainy, but it had a good overall flavor.

Kamikaze Taco:  This was probably the weakest of what we ordered, which was disappointing since it was what I was most looking forward to.  I found the fish to lack much flavor and taste.  Just not much taste to it.

Little Vegetables Taco: I thought it was good for a vegetarian entree, my wife thought "it was fine."

Yucca Fries:  Seriously...these are out of this world. Incredible!  A must have!

Guacamole:  My wife described this best...."it was ok."  The taste matched the color, as it was a little off and had a brownish appearance to it. Just didn't appear real fresh.

So, as I said before, it was good.  I'd certainly go back and grab a quick bite on the way home from work but not really worth going out of my way for.  The portions were decent and appropriate for the price.  While it didn't exceed any of my expectations, its a decent option for the area.
