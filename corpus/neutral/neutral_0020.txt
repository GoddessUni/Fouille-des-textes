Ordered delivery from here last night using Grubhub. I live in Fairmount and was surprised I was in their delivery radius. Definitely a good thing to note. My estimated delivery time was 45- 55 minutes and exactly 45 minutes later I got a call saying that my food had arrived. I met the $10 delivery minimum with an order of spicy tuna and shrimp tempura rolls. Both rolls were nicely prepared. They didn't fall apart when eaten with chopsticks or dipped into soy sauce. The spicy tuna wasn't overly spicy, but nothing some wasabi couldn't fix. There was also a generous amount of shrimp tempura in the roll. 

I saved the menu and plan on ordering from here again. The rolls I tried were simple and exactly I wanted that day. The specialty rolls sounded good, as well.
