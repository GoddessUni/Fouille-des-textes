I was never excited to visit this place unless I am ordering sushi. That's probably the best and only reason one should order form here. Today I gave take-out a try. Ordered a LARGE beef and broccoli (pictured below) I'm sorry but I will be sticking to my usual take out place from now on.  I really was surprised by the serving amount. 

Customer service:Hope you enjoy walking on eggshells. It's a thumbs down. Would you believe that a lady working once said. No tip? Then took out the fried noodles out my bad. I ALWAYS ask for them and they ALWAYS,ALWAYS do not include them. Today is no different. 

I would recommend dine in only. However, service for sit in and take out should be the same.
