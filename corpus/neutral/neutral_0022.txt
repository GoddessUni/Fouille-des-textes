The day was Tuesday... It is not an understatement to say that we were struggling. We had been walking for hours, like Sue from Glee, some may say, and we needed water. The one person behind the counter was expected to serve a line of people, about 10 visiting from Mississippi! We wanted to be supportive, but felt confused when we sat hoping for water. After asking for water a second time, and telling her that we were very dehydrated, she finally gave us a glass of water. We were very grateful. We've never had beignets, so we think they were good. Not sure how they compare to other options? Someone, write us back :) Thx xo
