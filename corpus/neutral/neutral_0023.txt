I have very mixed feelings about this place. On the one hand, it's warm and inviting and smells great inside. The women working there are very sweet and welcoming. The grill cook even dances as she works. juggling all the orders like magic...
On the other hand, my breakfast came up to 17 bucks because of all the hidden up-sell charges. Also, the ingredients, while handled beautifully, were of very low quality. The steak was one of those super cheap sorta steaks where they use meat glue to make it look like one piece of meat. It comes in it's own little sleeve and is really not a good piece of meat. But the woman spiced and cooked it perfectly.
The hash-browns (Which I got charged extra for even though I didn't specifically order them) were actually kind of like home fries but smooshed together until they resembled mashed potatoes that were crisped up. Tasty, but I told the woman taking my order that I just wanted what the meal came with minus grits.
They don't even make their own biscuits anymore. A shame. 
The coffee was good and strong and kept full my entire time there. But I would go back simply because the staff, while a bit shady with the up-selling, were really sweet and accommodating.
