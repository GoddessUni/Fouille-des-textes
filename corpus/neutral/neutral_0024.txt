I just recently moved the Wesley Chapel. I was in search of the best chicken wing spot, not really caring for the usual beef o Brady's and some other smaller places. I decided to try New York's best pizza for their chicken wings .I was glad I did. by far the biggest ,meatest and best cookd chicken wing in the area .sauces are pretty good .i chose to get them naked and put whatever sauce I want on them at the house. that being said ,I ordered a stuffed shells dinner for 14.99 one evening for my lady ,wasn't really well done and for 14.99 .I won't be ordering it again. but the chicken wings are what I'll come back for again and again
