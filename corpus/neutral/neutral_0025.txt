Love their food, avoid their delivery. It took them an hour to deliver a Cobb salad and I am literally around the corner from them on 19th and Market. Also, they no longer have the $5 wrap Mondays. It's $6 now.

Their Cobb salad is great, chicken Caesar wrap is also incredible. All of their wraps are incredible, but it's hard to find a place that uses real chicken and that's what makes the chicken Caesar wrap so finger-lickin' good!

Do not get the crispy chicken salad. The chicken is pounded to 2 mm thin and there is too much breading for the amount of chicken. Their taco salad left me severely disappointed. Other than that, I probably won't be ordering from them any time soon unless I go in person or order ahead.
