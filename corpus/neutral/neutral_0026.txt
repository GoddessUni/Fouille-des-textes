3 stars only cause some of my people enjoyed there meals.. (and the service was overall good)

I tend to believe that everyone and everything should be enjoyed .. my biggest disappointment is when they can't get your food to the table hot.. HELL warm would of been nice even .. my added lobster was room temp and rubbery.. my guests burger was really over cooked and you could tell it sat due to the cheese had gotten hard on the edges and his side order of garlic mash was room temp to touch and grey looking 

After three opportunities to remove the old plates and the end of the table (right in from of me & guest) as the pile grew .. and as the entrees were coming I had just stood up and removed the used plates to a side tray .. server says oh thank you I'd of gotten that.. three strikes and I do it for myself !!  Cause I'm admitting I'm a server of 30 years (we don't do our job the same way )
