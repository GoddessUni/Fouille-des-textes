Having been here twice, I have to agree with other reviewers that the main reason Audrey Claire survives is its location.  You can't argue that it's pretty much perfectly situated as a cutesy BYO.  And cute it is - they really do a good job of cultivating that atmosphere.  Don't get me wrong - the food is very tasty, and I've had a great time whenever I've been.

That said, it's pretty telling that I had a better time the first time I went to Audrey Claire - when my meal was paid for.  The prices on their menu are pretty up there given what's on there, and overall, not a lot of the dishes work well with each other, which is tough because the menu is designed for you to throw together a bunch of different things.

I'll probably be back, if someone else is picking up the bill.
