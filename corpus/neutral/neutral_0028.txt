Went to dinner last night with a large group of people for a friend's birthday. Everything went great. The servers were attentive and efficient. Until the birthday celebration. They serenaded the birthday girl and put a tin foil hat on her head, which was cute and all BUT the free dessert was a Dixie shot cup of whipped cream with a candle in it. Come on. Really? That's just disrespectful. If you're going to offer birthday celebrations, at least have a friggin cupcake ready. 

Still a good place for a casual, but slightly upscale Mexican meal. But don't take people for their birthdays, especially if they like dessert.
