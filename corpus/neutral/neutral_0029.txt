I was visiting family in Sparks and my sister recommended this spot as she had eaten here before. I was looking forward to eating in a restaurant so we went for breakfast before I left for home. They were only allowing 50% of normal capacity. We went early and I'm glad we did since there was quite a few people waiting when we finally left. I ordered chilaquiles since I had never had them before. I ordered a side of country potatoes as well. The food took fooorrrevvver to arrive. The place is quite small and I could see our food sitting there. When they finally served the food, I had hash browns on my plate instead of country potatoes. I didn't want to send the plate back because there was no telling when I would get my food back. One thing I can say about my breakfast- SALT!! My food had absolutely no flavor and the chilaquiles were soggy. I did not enjoy my breakfast at all. So disappointed.
