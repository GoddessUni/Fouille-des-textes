I was really craving a lamb shawarma and a nice greek salad, so we made it to Alyan's on a Saturday evening. The space is very casual, with a pretty cool glass ceiling room in the back. Our food came out quickly and the portions were generous, but the salad was so sad! The veggies didn't seem fresh and they were water-logged. There was basically no flavor, and the feta was really disappointing. This salad was also inside my shawarma pita, which didn't help the taste. I wouldn't order either of these things again, although I thought the service was great. Sorry, Alyan's!
