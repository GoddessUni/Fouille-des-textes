What happened here? This was one of my favorite eateries? So this was my first stop while back in Santa Barbara and what an average disappointing experience. It's like trying to recreate that fabulous first date. Usually it gets better but the second date shouldn't be worse than the first?! Make sense? I'm going to need some jewelry.

Ordering was easy and fast. The place was not too busy. We ordered the fish tacos and the squash quesadilla.

Sadly for the price the servings were not as generous as our last visit.  

The slaw on the tacos was bland. 

The squash "quesadilla" was actually an empanada?  

The salad was missing some cranberries.

Maybe they changed chefs?

Overall, for the price point and lack of flavor on the tacos...and small servings... I didn't return for the rest of my visit in Santa Barbara.
