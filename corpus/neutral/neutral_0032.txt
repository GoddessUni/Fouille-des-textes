I was fairly intrigued when someone told me there was a "Chipotle like" Mediterranean restaurant that opened up. So me an a few friends went by to give it a try. The food was not bad, but they failed at imitating chipotle. If you want to imitate chipotle, it should be as good or even better than what you are trying to imitate. The food was mehh... (Edible but not impressive) and the price was way overpriced to what you were getting. I ordered your standard bowl and was charged about $11. I feel like I would have been more satisfied paying $8 at Chipotle for better tasting food. 

On a 1-10 scale, 10 being the best.
1. Originality - 0
