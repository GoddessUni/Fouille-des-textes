Upon entering Piccolo's you immediately pick up the much anticipated fragrance of homemade Italian cuisine. Being able to scope the place we had no wait before we were happily greeted. This restaurant is in two halves nicely decorated with just the right ambiance. Since it was a Tuesday evening, maybe a quarter full to capacity we were taken to the furthest, smallest table right by the open kitchen. Our music was the clatter of pots and pans and the wait staff station happened to be right behind me. 

Our waiter greeted us in a timely manner and most pleasant. We gladly listened to the evenings specials and that is where it started going down hill for me. There was so many specials and with a heavy Italian fast speaking accent, I had no idea what was said. (Much rather see them written with the prices.) 

My companion and I noticed the prices were not as affordable as advertised. Before we made our final selection we were asked if we were ready to place our order only once before we were. 

You have a choice of soup or salad with your entree. Fresh rolls were served, one for each of us. No comment....... 

Dinner was served with very nice portions. The food was fresh. 
The bus boy did refill the water once but could not wait to clear the table before we were through eating on several attempts. What's with that???? 
Would I go back? M a y b e. Maybe not, but not in a hurry.
