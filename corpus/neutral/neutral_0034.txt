Not bad but not great either, I'm guessing people have different standards when it comes to sushi depending where you're from. Being that I live in SoCal I was hoping this place would live up to the 4 star reputation but it definitely fell short. The oysters were awesome but the sushi just wasn't as "fresh" as I'm used to and the edamame (something I thought was impossible to mess up, was extremely soggy) the Salmon sashimi tasted good but I'm shocked by how small the slices were since they were less than half the size I'm used to and cost more to boot. Overall I wasn't impressed but I also didn't hate it, I just likely won't be back and will probably just wait on eating sushi again till I get back to California or when I'm dining in the city.
