When it comes to hamburgers, I've totally become my mother. TEN DOLLARS?? For a BURGER?? It'd better be damned good!

Well. It wasn't.

I ordered the Big Kahuna burger, which is supposed to be a teriyaki marinated burger with pineapple and cheese. One very long wait and one overcooked, flavorless burger later, I took two bites and handed it back to our server. I should mention that I really do not like beef burgers, and was disappointed there was no turkey burger or veggie burger option (aside from black bean, which just sounded weird with their toppings.) 

The cheese added no flavor. There was no teriyaki that I could taste and the pineapple wasn't even passably ripe. The fries had obviously been reheated and were inedible. I didn't feel like waiting another 30-40 minutes for something else, so I just opted to sit there and watch my friend eat. This place made me crabby. It's a burger. Your name is Hamburger Mary's. Come on. 

So, if you don't come to Hamburger Mary's for the food, you definitely come in for the super fun ambiance, right? Which is what I was looking forward to. Unfortunately, we were seated upstairs at a high top table in what looked like any other sports bar I've ever visited. Absolutely nothing special about that dining area, unless you're really into old sports memorabilia. The downstairs is really awesome looking, though and I might have had more fun if we could have been seated there. 

It was really a two-star experience, but I'm giving three because I'm hoping this place pulls it together soon. I definitely want to like it, but I see nothing special enough to warrant a second visit.
