Now first of, I've never had Oysters and that's why I had to try them. I had the Oysters Mignoinette and my brother had the some baked oysters. I'd like to tell you that I was swept away in a breeze of sea air and transported to a place of pure taste... but no. There really isn't a lot to do to the oysters, sprinkle with chopped red onion and spash on the vinegar. The onion was a little too coarse chopped and my oysters had not been cleaned sufficiently on the outside therefore upon shucking them some dirt had been pushed into the oyster. Now this got me thinking and therefore I had a shot of whiskey at the end of dinner to ensure a quite evening. 

Now the baked oysters where far supperior too the oysters mignoinette in my mind.

Would I revisit, No
