Came here on a Wednesday night and it was a zoo. The cashier, I'm only assuming, was new/training. I ordered cookie dough ice cream, while hubby ordered key lime pie (which was a featured flavor). I guess they didn't have key lime pie in the register so she put down a lost in paradise ( which is like a weak strawberry ice cream) and told us she'll cross it out and write key lime pie. Anyway, after waiting 30 minutes, I get my order and it turns out she crossed out cookie dough and wrote key lime, and we got a lost in paradise. I basically got a lost in paradise with my hubby's toppings of choice, while he got key lime with my toppings of choice. When I confronted them, they tried to tell me it's what I ordered. Just stop right there. After they realized they were wrong, or the cashier made the mistake, the one gentleman was very nice and refunded me $8 and offered to make a new one for me while I kept the wrong ones... what am I supposed to do with 4 ice creams? No thanks. Appreciate the offer though. Just 3 stars though for refunding me and acknowledging the error. Lost two stars because it was a zoo and I just wanted to get out of there.
