I'm a little disappointed by this place.  I was taken here by a friend who loves Chabaa, the sister restaurant.  It was the first time for the both of us, but the idea of Thai tapas was pretty awesome and carried high expectations from Chabaa.

Firstly, the menu is pretty nice - a tapas style array of different sized dishes serving meat, seafood, and fruits, plus a bunch of lame side dishes that we immediately decided against.  The sides felt kind of Craft-esque, made up of starches and veggies, but they sounded too lame for us to bother (steamed rice noodles? no thanks). 

We ended up ordering a ton of dishes (6 mediums, 2 entrees for 3 people), but only because the waiter pushed us to order two extra.  Mind you, the portions weren't even that big, but I was carrying the eating load for two girls.

The problem was the quality of the food was really varied.  The shrimp dumplings were a really bad version of Chinese shiu-mai.  The sausage dish ($8) was literally a pork sausage, sliced onto a plate.  But the main course of sea bass with thai basil and coconut sauce was wonderful and worth every penny.  The one suggestion the waiter made that we loved was the pork neck - sounds gross to you but amazing to me.

Oh yeah, and the drinks were good.  Nicely paired wine, beer, and cocktail mix.  The coconut mojito tasted like it was made with malibu, but I'm not complaining.

In all, the place is good if you know what to get.  But there are too many so-so dishes to dine empirically.
