I can't say this place is bad, but I can't say it's the best.  First let me start by say these cheesesteak is filled with meat and messy just the way a cheesesteak is meant to be.  The staff there is nice and it appears to be a hot spot for all the locals and people that work in the area.  Now it someone does not tell you exactly where it is you will miss it.  I found it because a friend said it is in like a little shopping area.  I gave it 3 stars because I felt it lacked flavor and it felt like I could have done the same thing at home.  I have had a cheesesteak made by a friend that packed so much more flavor, with the same amount of grease and meat.  Would I try them again? Yeah if I'm over there but I wouldn't go out of my way.  I didn't get a pick of my husband's cheesesteak but it was fully loaded with onions and sauce and his was not bad, but had way to much pickles on it and it still lacked flavor.
