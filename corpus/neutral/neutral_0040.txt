Tried this place when it first opened and went back a couple times.  If you get on their email list, they will send you coupons periodically ($10 off $30?).  I was excited that it was so close to where I used to work.  Now that I moved out of Philly, I wish I went here more often.

Their noodle dish with duck is the best dish that I had there.  It had a very mealy taste, umami.  They had the perfect amount of grease to them, and the meat was soft and tasty.  Other dishes were ok, not spectacular or memorable.  It's pretty good Chinese food, and they had more variety that most.  This place seems a small notch up health-wise compared to other Chinese places.  It could be all in the image...

The service wasn't bad.  They were a little rushed at times during lunch, but that's expected.  Some of them were nice and tried to be funny, some didn't say much of anything.  Water was always filled.  They did ask if everything was ok most of the time.

Prices were cheap and the coupons made things even cheaper.  Although a great location, I think the fact that they were on the first floor of the Sheraton made their visibility less optimal than most of the other restaurants on that street.  I would forget that it's there until I would get a craving for  Chinese and think about what my options are.

Definitely worth the money and a try.
