:(   This is a very difficult review for me to write! 

I arrived at about 6:30 , and yes it was busy. My two part order was taken fairly quickly , by 6:35.I ordered Guacamole Dip, Truckee River Special, Sopapillas , Coffee and a Mango Margarita,to eat there and to go I ordered three tacos ,Carnitas,Asada, and Birria.

Some time between 6:35 and 7:13 I recieved the Sopapillas! 
I got my Truckee River Special at 7:13 , when I asked about my Guacamole and why I had already gotten the Sopapillas! I got the remake of the Sopapillas at 7:19 and my to go order at 7:31. 

At around 7:53 I found some bones in my fish! Then was asked by a different server if everything was okey! I said yes , I did not want to go into details as to why it was not okey! At 7:58 I was asked if I wanted more water. 

I finished my fish at 8:01 , at 8:07 the table was cleared and I got the bill at 8:12, by 8:17 I had paid my bill!

I got more Guacamole on my plate with my fish than came as my appitizer, which was $4.95!  I also would have probably ordered another cocktail if someone had asked if I wanted one.

I was VERY disappointed in the service tonight ! It being busy does not explain why it was so disjointed ! Really desert before the appitizer! 

My past reviews I gave 4 and 5 stars , tonight they go down to 3 stars! Sorry guys but though the food was still quite good the service sucked tonight!!! :(
