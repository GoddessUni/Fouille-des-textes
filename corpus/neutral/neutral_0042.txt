I visited Philly Memorial Day weekend 2018 and loved the Pat's Philly cheesesteak I had.  

Three years earlier in March 2015 visit to Philly, upon recommendation from a friend, she said that our mutual friend said to go to Jim's over Pat's or Geno's, but then in 2018 I found out directly from that friend that he had never been to Pat's or Geno's before.  Jim's has an old charm with 1930's art deco style architecture, and I liked the pictures of the famous people who dined in there over the years, which we observed while we were waiting in the long line.

I ordered the sandwich and decided to try it the 'Philly way' wit the cheese whiz.  I had never had cheese whiz on a cheesesteak before, but I was willing to try it the genuine way that the locals eat their cheesesteaks.  The cheese whiz came out of these massive tubs almost like beer kegs.  I don't like onions; so no onions for me.

The place was small but on two levels.  We walked up to the second level and found seats.  So, I did enjoy the cheese whiz, but for me, the meat and sandwich overall was kind of bland, and there wasn't enough meat.  I was very hungry since I hadn't eaten much that day in anticipation for the Philly cheesesteak with a large mound of meat.  So, that was a negative for me as well.  The sandwich was decent, but nothing special to me.  Most places in the DC-Baltimore area that I've had cheesesteaks are better.  

My friends had it even worse.  My one friend is lactose intolerant and the other generally follows Kosher; so neither of them got cheese.  They weren't impressed, and I said yeah, you two got screwed because the cheese was what made the sandwich at least average.
