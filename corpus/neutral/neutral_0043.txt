A group of six of us decided to try Verducci's on Blind Pass Road for dinner.  The restaurant was not busy when we arrived.  Three  of us ordered chicken parmesan.  Give dinners came out in s timely manner. The waitress said the other chicken parmesan be out in a minute.    The server told us again three more times that the other entree would be out in a minute.  

We saw at least one other chicken parmesan served before our 20 minute wait was for our sixth entree was served.  

Food was good but something is really wrong in how they are running their restaurant.
