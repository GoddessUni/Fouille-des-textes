Was craving for some good Gyros and didn't feel like crossing the bridge. Found this place and had to try. Looks decent inside with a huge clean kitchen. The restaurant side had nice Mediterranean decor. However, why don't I see a big spit of meat rotating on a heat lamp? Immediately tells me the place uses frozen gyro meat. Well I still had to to order the gyro and added falafel on the side. My companion for a kebob platter. The food was mediocre and unfortunately the fries was better.  Should have crossed the bridge and went to a Halal food cart vendor for a tastier meal for half the price.  The guy working was very friendly though!
