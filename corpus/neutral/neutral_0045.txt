I can't believe this place!! There were ants in my drink, witch they still made me pay $3.00 for a drink that had BUGS! They also made me pay four extra dollars for a non cash payment. They also make you pay extra for sides. They ask you if would like fries with that but then charges you for them. Their scallops were horrendous they smell disgusting and smell like fish ass. They make weird 1960 pot jokes witch is not what I want to hear while trying to enjoy a meal with my family. With all of this there is one positive thing about our dining experience their... their hot sand witch was pretty delicious and I would recommend if you dine their. Although their Cuban sand witch could be bought at seven eleven. Overall I wouldn't recommend this place as my first choice but if you need a place to get a drink with bugs this is a good place for you!
