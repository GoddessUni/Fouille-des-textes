The classic tehina milkshake was 10 stars. It was AMAZING. As for the falafel...eh. I love falafel and this was very good but maybe just didn't live up to what I expected from all the hype? I got the harrisa falafel. First bummer was the sauce seemed to be more all over the wrapper than inside the pita. Second bummer was that the pita wasn't warm. I enjoyed eating it but it was a little dry because of the sauce issue. I will 100% go back to Goldie to try the other shake flavors, but not sure if I'd order food again.
