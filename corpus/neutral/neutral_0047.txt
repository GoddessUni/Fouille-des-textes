We came for lunch and were one of 2 tables seated in the restaurant. The decor is dated and the color of most of the restaurant is a dismal pink. The chips and duck sauce that came to the table were good, I love the extra large ones and they serve those here. I ordered the Chicken w/ Cashew Nuts lunch special. This came with choice of rice and soup. The wonton soup was also well seasoned and the meat in the wontons was flavorful. My chicken with cashews was good as well. It was made with celery, carrots, mushrooms and zucchini. The sauce was delicious and the portion was just right. But the fried rice wasn't desirable at all. I took one bite and pushed it to the side.
