I like the duality that a previous reviewer suggested separating Mad Mex the bar from Mad Mex the restaurant. I've been here several times, most often for drinks. They have a respectable collection of beers, and their margaritas are excellent as well. I would give the bar 4 stars.

The restaurant, however, might get two or three stars. The food I've had here has been EXTREMELY hit or miss. A lot of the chip dips they have are fairly so-so, the avacado tomatillo dip I found to be disgusting when I had it. The mac-and-cheese balls are terrible (though my friends swear by them) but the shimp and mushroom taquitos are delicious. I just recently had dinner there, and I was quite happy with what I got. You definitely won't get authentic mexican food here, but can be mighty tasty for what it is.
