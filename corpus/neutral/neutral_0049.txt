Stopped by this place by chance after I tried Luke's Lobster right next door and ordered the Back in the Day hotdog (your everyday hotdog + two pieces of fried cod fish and onions).  It tasted exactly as you would think - nothing special but gets the job done! They have various types of hotdogs with both standard/unique toppings added that makes this place different from your regular ketchup/mustard/relish hotdog you would get at a BBQ.  In terms of pricing, I think all the hotdogs sold here are just slightly overpriced in my opinion.  

I have heard from others this a pretty popular place to stop by after going out with friends for a late night snack.  Self serve tables on either ends to accommodate medium sized groups!
