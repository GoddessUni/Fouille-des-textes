The location of bullseye burger is great! It is right in the middle of Keswick Village, a lively Main Street of restaurants and local stores. The bullseye burger menu is extremely diverse with items from tacos, snacks, and of course burgers. The burgers have a diverse and creative range of flavors and combinations. I ordered the bullseye burger which had Parmesan cheese, bacon, and Cesar dressing. I have never had this combination before and it was surprisingly great. Another great thing about this place is that they put two patties on each burger!! A definite surprise and makes sense with the higher price. The downs is the quality of cooking. All though the flavors and combinations are creative and original I ordered my burger as medium rare and got it well done both times I went. The patties were also nothing extremely special. For not cooking a burger properly and having burger in the restaurant name I give the rating a 3/5. Would go again but definitely equal or better burger shops.
