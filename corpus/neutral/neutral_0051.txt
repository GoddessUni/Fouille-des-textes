I am a huge fan of Publix. And I've always bragged about their bakery. But something has changed recently. Lately everything I have gotten from there has been barely edible. The blueberry muffins have a very artificial flavoring to them, the coffee cakes are very heavy on baking soda and the dough is very wet and doughy, even the chocolate ganache cake that I have fantasized about in the past, is just not that great anymore either. I don't know what happened but somebody needs to pay attention. I still love Publix and I will continue to give the bakery a try but the last six months or so have been disappointing.
