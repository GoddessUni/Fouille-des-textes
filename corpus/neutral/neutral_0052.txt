Disappointed- save your $. My reasons: 
-fairly pricey compared to other places in town
-5 people working and it took 20 min to get 1 churro and an ice cream sandwich. 
-Food tasted ok, churro was still doughy in the center which led me to believe that maybe they came frozen, then fried on location? Maybe it's just a thicker dough than I'm used to. 
-There is no posted menu, you have to get a handheld menu from the counter, and ice cream flavor choices are not listed on the menu. 
It's ok if you're nearby, I'll be driving across town for better options elsewhere...
