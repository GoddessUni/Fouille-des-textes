It's located in the southwest terminal, fairly small island. The food choices are very limited, and mostly sports bar appetizer items. They were out of 2 items, which made it even more slim pickings, but did have the Club, which was a massive sandwich. We're talking maybe 4 inch clearance in height due to the huge chunks of ham and turkey. The meat to sandwich ratio was off, making it a not so great meal, but you definitely get your money's worth. As for the pizza stick things, they seemed like thin hot pockets, not my thing either. Did have a bunch of games playing though, and decent beer selection.
