Triangle Tavern is my go-to lunch spot when my non-adventurous family comes to town (still trying to convince my parents to try brussels sprouts, which I'm pretty sure is the opposite of what is supposed to happen).  I have tasted pretty much all the sandwiches without beef on the menu and a few of the appetizers.  

Some of the food deserves five stars (vegan buffalo wings--the best non-meat wings I've ever tasted, vegan meatball sub--delicious, add the sharp provolone if you are not vegan), but the rest is just A-OK (vegan roast beef, which was dry with a watery horseradish sauce to compensate; chicken parm, chicken was overcooked and a little chewy, fries, which are fine but you have to order separately as they don't come with your up to $12 sandwich).  

Triangle Tavern has a great beer menu, service is usually fine, if occasionally a little slow (I think there may be one server for all the tables in the back), and recently (I think) added a brunch menu that includes vegan mushroom scrapple that is intriguing and will definitely get me back in to try the brunch offerings as well.
