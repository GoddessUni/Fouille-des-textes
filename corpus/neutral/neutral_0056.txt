Haven't been to the Reading Terminal in quite some time however once I entered' it was like I had never left. 

I believe you can get discounted parking for the terminal. 

I walked around for a bit and decided on thai food. This is a walk up counter. You tell them what you want from the menu and they prepare. The selection is very small. I only saw salmon or shrimp. The shrimp were a nice size. Although it s says salmon, something tells me it isn't because how flat it is. I ordered "salmon" with rice which was overcooked and 3 small pieces of brocolli. I had them put a sweet chilli sauce over everything and that helped the flavor. I also ordered the chicken spring rolls and they were delicious.  Not too greasy. My Sister had the red vegetable pad thai which had a broth and she added "Salmon"; I tasted hers and it was very tasty!!! I wish I could have sent mine's back. 

Overall everything was ok. I would go back and try something different.  

Enjoy!
