I love the mission and message and overall I like their menu options. There is just a major lack of consistency. Every time I order it NEVER comes out like the time before. I get the same açaí bowl every time, and not once has it had the same toppings on it from the time before, and only once did it have the toppings that were listed on the menu. Just started getting avocado toast and last time, there wasn't much oil or red pepper flakes on it and this time it is DROWNING in it. I will continue coming because of the convenience and again, overall I do like what they have. I just hate feeling like I never know what I'm getting each time.
