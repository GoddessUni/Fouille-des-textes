The food here is very good and they have a good selection of beers. It's does have an old school saloon type of feel to it. I've read some of the other reviews and I agree on the bottled water. It is kinda of ridiculous they don't serve tap water here. They do have some of the best wings and mussels in the Philly area. It's chill and I really like the musicians they have on the weekends. It is more relaxed but on nights where they have live music, people do dance and it can be a really fun night. It's a place that I can really have a lot of fun on some nights and on others, the atmosphere can really put me to sleep.

Good - Food, variety of beers, live music

Bad - Does not serve tap water, bathrooms are disgusting, cash only.
