3 stars with the possibility of 5!!!

Walking the streets of the French Quarters when we hear a live jazz band and decide to stop in. The host was a total jerk. Like seriously, a complete buzz kill and borderline making us walk away. Ultimately our hunger pushed us through the door anyways. Waitress comes up, doesn't show any signs of personality nor does she write any of our order down but simply goes off of memory. Well, you guessed it right, she screwed the order up. So far our experience is awful. Here's where things turn. The live music was phenomenal. Great band playing some vintage New Orleans sound. Even better though? The food. The food was absolutely amazing and exactly what we needed at the end of a long weekend. 

Overall happy we stopped here although the servers here need a to lighten up and realize their attitudes are completely out of line. A little personality goes a long way.
