The main dining room is very pretty and warm - the staff very friendly.  There is a fairly large amount of beers on tap and the menu is big without being overwhelming.

There were 3 of us here for lunch, so we got to share a few items.  The Duck Wing Lollipops and the Lobster Flatbread were both delicious.  The "winning entr√©e" was the Grilled Trout, followed by the Flat Iron Steak Salad.  At a far distant 3rd place was a very disappointing Shrimp Cavatappi.

Prices were very reasonable - don't know if it's the same menu for dinner but assume that it is.  For the above, with 5 beers, before tip, the bill came to $113.   An expensive lunch but (almost) totally worth it.  We will go back again.
