If you are a Drexel or Penn student and considering Fresh grocer, do yourself a favor and walk an extra two blocks to the Supreme Shop n Bag. Their prices are far far better. They have a decent selection of most general items. Their produce is reasonably fresh (at least average for produce you can get in Philly) and fairly priced. 
They carry a great selection of Latin cooking ingredients and food/drink items which is one of the main reasons why I like this store! There are usually always great sales on yogurt which if you eat yogurt like me really will save you some $. 

Worst part is the checkout. Broken belts and employees who do not always know the name of the fruit/veggie you are trying to buy. The checkout can sometimes be a slow process.
