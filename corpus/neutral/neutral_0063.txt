Three of us went to Gangchu last weekend.  The atmosphere was great, they were playing good background music and had a nice indoor and outdoor space, separated by the bar.  The restaurant is doing a great job limiting the inside tables, only sitting people at every other.  

We were so excited to be trying out the restaurant and couldn't figure out what we wanted so we did a little bit of a lot. We ordered the wings and all the sauces, the kimchi pancake, japchae and the beef bulgogi and here's my take.  (Just level setting my mothers Korean and I have been eating this cuisine my entire life)

Wings: the batter and fry on them were crispy and delicious and so were the sauces.  Unfortunately, I cant remember which one I liked the best

Kimchi pancake: these were excellent, the crispy fried edges really made this stand out.

Japchae:  I love japchae but not here.  This had to be the saltiest japchae I have ever had, I took one bite and couldn't eat anymore. However, out of three us there wasn't tons left. 

Beef Bulgogi:  this was just okay, not a huge fan of the marinade they are using, something is just missing.  Again, if you don't know any different you may love this but I personally wasn't a big fan.
