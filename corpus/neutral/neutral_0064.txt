It's nowhere near worth the price of admission. 25+ dollars for pizza is absolutely crazy.  That being said, the pizza was pretty good. Is it revolutionizing the pizza world? no. In a city filled with great places to get pizza, I'm surprised people are willing to pay these prices. 

in terms of how they are handling post-covid dining, they get 5 stars. phone ordering, attentive servers, temperature checking, tables are spread out, etc etc. couldn't be happier with that. 

If someone has never been to pizzeria beddia before, I would advise picking up a plain pizza, eating it in the alley, and deciding for yourself if it tickles your taste buds enough to want to pay those mercedes benz prices. Me personally, I would rather go elsewhere to get more bang for my buck, while still getting delicious pizza. 

3 pizzas + 3 beers + glass of wine + tip = 145 tab. 3 dollar sign pricing should not apply to a pizza joint.
