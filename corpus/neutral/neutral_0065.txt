I am sure the locals with disagree with me but maybe it was just too hyped up and my expectations were too high.  Even though the operation seems very authentic and everything is fresh I did find the dishes bland.  We ordered the tamales, tri-tip tacos and a cheese and pasilla pepper quesadilla.  The quesadilla was just ok, the taco, the beef clearly needed some more seasoning but the tamales were very good.  So good I almost went to 4 stars but 1/3 wasn't enough to drive my mouse over to star #4.  The price is great but it is such a popular place expect a long wait.
