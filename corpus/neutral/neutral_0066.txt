The second* Chinese place in conshy.
Take out only. Is NOT open late night.
And between this place and win Wah
Honestly there is no winner. 
I think to have a really good Chinese dinner - you need to "take out" from both the places to make your meal balanced. Cause 
I prefer the schezuan from winwah, but the fried rice from dragon and Phoenix

Good place. I like their fried rice. They do it well. Not dry, is tasteful and has veggies protein and is a standalone entree.
But they also sweeten their spicy pot. Like using ketchup in the hot dishes.. WHY!
But if you like some spice in your food like I do - you are better off with win Wah - but everything else I think this place can do better or as good.
