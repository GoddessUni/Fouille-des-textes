Dinner here 8/12/16.  Restaurant is even smaller than it looks or that I had anticipated.  The restaurant provides the atmosphere of a small European cafe which is a nice reprieve from the large behemoth restaurants that we tend to have in the US.  This was a nice treat and enjoyable cafe to have dinner.

The menu is fairly large with a wide array of offerings.  The prices seem somewhat high which was a discouragement.  Our party each ordered different items which would give us a cross view of the menu.

In general the portions were reasonably sized to large.  The preparation and taste of the meals was fair.  Nothing particularly stood out, but then again nothing was bad.  In particular, I'd like to comment on the Chicken Piccata which was swimming in too much sauce and had way too many mushrooms and was presented as simply chicken breasts rather than the traditional beaten chicken filets.

The soup was okay, while the salads were weak with little dressing and very little flavor to the dressing.

Would love to have found a nice Italian cafe that could have become a regular place.  That is not the case, and there wasn't anything that would cause us to come back quickly.
