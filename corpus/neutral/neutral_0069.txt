Meh. But not enough to completely throw them into a 2 star review. Quite a bit on the pretentious side, for just OK coffees, I heard the lady in front of me order a macchiato, and they felt the need to inform her that this was not going to be the "macchiato she is used to at lower quality coffee houses, and this would be a real macchiato" to which she promptly replied, "I know what a macchiato is." It was a funny interaction to witness, we moved quickly through line, and I had a Chai and my girlfriend had a latte. The Chai was super watery so I asked them to re-make it, and they were super friendly and moved it to the front of the line, but then Chai number two was also incredibly watery, and when I let them know they just said that that is how they make their chai. Hmmm, ok, well it doesn't taste good, and this is coming from a coffee house lover who has been to just about every little place in town! 

Upside my coworker's latte she said was amazing and the patrons and employees alike were all happy and having a good time. Great atmosphere and awesome outside patio for people watching and soaking up some sunshine!
