This hotel is functional but not for a "nice vacation". I see they are renovating rooms which is truly needed. I believe the new rooms are in the west tower and I'm staying on the east tower. 
Bedroom- old. And honestly gross. Headboard is torn up, shower curtain has mildew stains, there is what seems to be "human glue" on the carpet next to the bed. Trash bin has something old on it that had been spilled and not wiped off.
Downstairs is a casino! And a few bars. First night the bartenders were pretty bad.
Soda water instead of tonic, just overall unhappy service.
Middle bar was great.
Food/banquet service people were not personable
And actually scowled when we were in line getting food. 
Front desk is always busy but they were helpful. 
Bottom line-
Wait for the renovations and ask for a new room,
And this hotel Needs to train its service to be pleasant.
