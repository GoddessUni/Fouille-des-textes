I visited the Salem City Cafe last night (Friday night) with my party of 6.  We were running a bit behind but they were accommodating  and didnt rush us.  The menu selection seemed very narrow but covered a decent amount of food groups. (steak, seafood, vegetarian, gluten free selections)  There was a page of appetizers, a page of light fare and a page of entrees with each page having 10 to 15 selections.
When ordering time came, there were a few specials of the evening.  We all made our selections but found out that one of the specials was not available and they had run out of meatloaf.  Ok, so we order, and we are hanging out eating our calamari and edamame appetizers which were very good.  About 15 minutes later, we find out that two of the entrees that we ordered were unavailable and they had run out of them as well. (this seems kind of odd since it is a Friday evening and the place is about 50% full) 
Other than the ordering mix up, everything else was good.  The portion sizes were filling but not too much.  The ambiance was very nice and the interior was surprising (good surprising) for the area.  The table setup was so that you could keep your conversations private without whispering.  Overall, good dinner, would've liked to known what entrees weren't available when we sat down, but positive experience otherwise.
