Food was pretty good! We both had the house salad which was fresh and awesome. The entree size is good for a meal and less than $5! The roast beef was incredible! Great selection of awesome beers from all over the place with good specials every day. We got Missouri pints for $3.50 which is a steal downtown. 

The service was extremely slow which is why I only gave it 3 stars. I also got the beer cheese soup and it was much spicier than I anticipated! It came in a sourdough bread bowl but would have been really good in a pretzel bread bowl.
