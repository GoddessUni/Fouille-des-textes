Cafe Fresca is a really nice restaurant, though you wouldn't guess it from the outside. Sitting in a pretty empty strip mall, you are amazed by the decor when you walk in.

The staff are not the friendliest-- or maybe they are. I couldn't really tell. The server seemed annoyed to take my drink order but then called me honey. I make it a point to say please and thank you, so maybe she warmed up after I made an attempt to be friendly.

So the food is alright. We order crab cakes to start, which were pretty delicious! I then ordered the muffelata because I was curious. Um, so definitely only order the half. Unless you are sharing a whole one with a small village, the half is more than enough. Really, it is too much for person since it comes with french fries. I easily at half of my entree and took the rest home.

Lunch time gets pretty busy. It is nice to see that this place has such a large following. My food wasn't that amazing, but clearly something keeps all these people coming back.
