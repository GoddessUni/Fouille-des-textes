High hopes for a neighborhood pub in New Tampa that started off great and went downhill quick.  First the good, service was excellent.  Crunchy chicken salad and wings are great.  Now the needs work... Last four beers (last two trips) we ordered were either out or ran out on our pour.  Last time no mahi.  This time mahi ordered blackened and it came out no spices just burnt and over done.  Burgers used to be really good but, tonight it was unevenly cooked and tasted like the grill hadn't been cleaned.  I feel the burger meat is now different than when they started.  Not sure why the rapid slide in quality or if this was just two bad nights but, tough to spend 60 dollars + 12 tip on bad food and second/third choice beers.  We're gonna take a pass for awhile.
