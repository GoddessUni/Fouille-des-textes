First time ordering from this place and had the food delivered. I clearly put no contact delivery on the order but the driver was more worried about a tip. He rang my doorbell and knocked on my door to ask me to sign the receipt (no signature line because he did not need a signature) and to tell me there is no place for a tip. Then he starts babbling on about how he has nothing to do with online and the service charge does not go to him!!!!! REALLY, CONTACTLESS MEANS DON'T KNOCK ON MY DOOR. to make matters worse, the food was just ok.
