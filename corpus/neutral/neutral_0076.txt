I am extremely 50/50 about Match. We will sometimes do a "boys night" and come to Match for dinner and then some roulette. The food at Match is always quite good. The prices are reasonable with their happy hour from 7-10. It's perfect timing really - have three hours worth of $4 highballs then go gambling. The service is always very "nice" but if I'm honest, it's not great. The servers themselves are very friendly and fun but I have found that your glass sits empty for a long time before they come around to refill it. And, being a former bartender, watching the bartender/floor manager/whatever he is make drinks is extremely painful. It takes so long for him to actually make the drinks that by the time they actually get to the table they are watery. It seriously makes me want to pull my hair out. I will most likely be back but more than likely be addressing it with the manager...because I like the place, but I can't take the service anymore!
