Here for a 2 night, no interruption, relaxing staycation with a room with a large whirlpool tub. The "no interruption" component is something advertised- no housecleaning bugging you; dial 0 if you need anything. Exactly what we wanted. 

9 am. Housekeeping banging on the door. We have no "due not disturb" door hanger because it's supposed to be something already known. Part of the package. 

Tried to call front desk (0) to request a DND sign or similar,  plus a second bathrobe. Called three times at different times. It just rang,  and rang,  and rang.  So now I'm yelping while I'm still here. 

Room is nice? Generally seems understaffed.
