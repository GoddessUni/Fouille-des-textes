We got to the hotel on a Friday around 1:30 so I went to the front desk to see when check in was. They said at 3 but they could check us in now. Thought that was awesome but they lady took probably around 12-15 minutes to check us in. She was having issues with her computer. 

After that we got up to our room (2573) and it was amazing. Super pretty & clean. The view was really spectacular as well. We hung out for awhile until we had to ready for our family's get together in the casino. This is when I jumped into the shower & started to shampoo my hair when the water went cold. No hot water at all. The water started at a luke warm temperature so I thought I'd jump in but NO. It switched to ice water right after so I had to rinse really quick in the cold water and get out of the shower. I couldn't believe it. I called the front desk to tell them we didn't have hot water & they said we would have to leave the shower running at least 20 minutes for the water to warm up. That was that. We didn't have time now to take showers. We had to meet up with our family. Then that evening it was the same thing.  Myself and my husband wanted to take a shower after being in the smokey casino all night but it was cold. We are not going to sit 20 minutes with the water running to then take a shower. 

So we couldn't take showers at all & we stayed two nights! 

I really enjoyed the hotel and the casino but jeez! I wouldn't have guessed the shower would have been cold. Over and over again. 

One other thing is that the bathroom shower towels were really rough. Thought that was kinda interesting compared to everything else in the room.
