So I thought I'd try to see if maybe I was incorrect in my first assessment of Federal Donuts and therefore decided to try the new location.  Sadly, my first judgment was correct.  This place just isn't that great and does not hold a candle to Doughnut Plant.  First, the staff was fairly curt and could not bother to remember my name although they asked for it (they made up a new one for me instead) and the line to order is very confusing.  Second, the doughnuts are simply not that good.  The flavors are not very strong and some just taste strange.  The best one I had was the maple bacon but even was not too flavorful.  For my maple bacon needs, I will head to Schmakery's in NYC for the perfect maple bacon cookie.  While there are occasionally stand out flavors, it is evident that there are far more duds and the menu just turns over to fast.
