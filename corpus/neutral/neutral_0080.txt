On my way to SF I stoped at their SB location to pickup lunch. I hate to say it, but the pastrami sandwich, was not worth over 35 minutes wait. It was super bland and nothing to brag about! I wonder that was their pandemic version! These days, it seems like a lot of restaurants are cutting corners and not as good as they used to be pre- pandemic. This place seems to be in high demand for some reason, so to retain customers ,they need to speed it up! Maybe start by hiring more workers?! 

I would like to give them another chance and try the other items on their menu, and see if I'd have a better luck, but not until I hear the wait is much shorter!
