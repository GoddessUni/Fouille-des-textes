My husband and I went here for brunch this morning. It was okay. A few things are keeping this review at 3 stars:
a) The parking is far away. We parked in the garage under the building but you have to be a resident to park near the elevator that is by Allium. 
b) It's got a very cold ambiance. It's got kind of a warehouse vibe going on but then everything else about the space is traditional. It's like ths space is bi-polar (or bi-WINNING if you are Charlie Sheen).
c) The food was just okay. I got the omelette of the day and home fries. The potatoes were good but the omelette was nothing special. And there wasn't really a lot of filling. I do not like when I get an omelette and have bites that are of just egg. I would say 20% of my bites were of just egg. 
d) The location is a little odd. And to be honest? The view is just so so. Maybe at night when you can see the twinkling lights of downtown it is cool, but during the day it's really nothing to get excited about.

If I make it to East Nashville for brunch I'm definitely heading to Mad Donna's and not to this place.
