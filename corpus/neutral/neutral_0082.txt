URBAN HONKYTONK: this is the kind of Bar (+food) where hunky contractors hang out after work, local gentry pick up late night take-out, regulars are known by name; and, true to genre, all are adroitly serviced by a flirtatious waitress in "hooterish" short shorts.  

MEH BURGER IS PRICIER THAN NEARBY PHIL'S. My cheeseburger was tasty but the bun was Sysco-like, with waffle fries it totaled $10.25. If it's a Grill (+bar) that you're interested in, by far the best price/value is Phil's build-your-own with a side for $9.75 just blocks away.

KINDA THE WHD'S FINN MC COOL'S but without the the suffocating cigarette smoke. Go to drink, eat elsewhere.
