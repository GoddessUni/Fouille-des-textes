I've always liked Jefferson' food and still do for the most part. Especially liked the wings. Notice some differences in the chicken wings from the way they were done years ago. Got a mixture of 50 wings for a party recently and two in particular were disappointing. Garlic Parm looked like they poured a ladle of some thick white sauce over them which I'm guessing is the garlic parm part. Not much taste and I noticed a number of people steer away from them. A few asked what was on them. Barbecue wings same way. Looked like they poured barbQ sauce over them after they put them in the styrofoam container. Wings were dripping with the sauce. They use to cook or maybe toss these wings with the flavor cooked on vs now, they just pour the sauce over the cooked wings in the container with whatever sauce. What happened Jefferson's?  New cooks? Please go back to the days of your perfect wings.
