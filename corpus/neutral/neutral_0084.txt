I haven't been here in years.  So, to be honest, I can't comment too much on the food.  I remember the pizza slices to be fairly good, even by Philly pizza standards.

The one thing that has always stuck out for me at this place is the abundance of '70s and '80s pro wrestling pictures on the walls and glass counter.  The pictures are old, not just in content but actually old.  I'm talking yellowed newspaper clippings old.  No counter worker I ever asked could tell me why they're there... or even really cared to talk about them at all.

But, for this reason and decent pizza by the slice, this place holds cult status in my mind.
