I went here today for a work lunch. I thought that the place was a typical steak place, brown and darkish.  We had a table of about 6 of us, and our service was exceptional.  Our waiter was very helpful, always checking on us, and made sure that our orders were perfect. In addition, he made sure we had enough to drink.
I ordered an Arnold Palmer there. Something so simple, yet it was so tasty to me.  I also had one of the lunch specials. Lunch specials are all under $12, and it comes with your choice of two sides. I thought that was a pretty good deal. Of course, though, I was not paying so it was an even better deal.
They have amazing bread that they serve as well. It's nice and warm, crusty and seasoned on the outside, soft and warm on the inside. Such yummy bread good news. I wish I did not love bread so so much.
I ordered a side salad with honey mustard dressing and roasted veggies for my side.  They had a vinigrette dressing but it had blue cheese, and I'm not a blue cheese lover. Honey mustard was very tasty, and the roasted veggies also had great seasoning.
My steak sandwich was served on french bread loaf, and cut in half. 
I had eaten so much bread, and drank so much of the YUMMY Arnold Palmers that I did not even eat the second half of my sandwich. That's okay, I soon ate it a few hours later, and it was still yummy. 
yes, I definitely liked this place, and it is nice for a lunch date, or a work corporate lunch.  The atmosphere seems more business, and to me that is more serious than a birthday or an anniversary, and that is why I would not recommend it for that. I guess i'm also the one that likes everything with details, lights, bright colors, etc.  Therefore, I will give it a 3.5 stars bc of the atmosphere. Food and Service was Awesome!
