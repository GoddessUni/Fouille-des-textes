It's a good please but this time there were no dipping sauces for the popcorn chicken and it just seemed like the two staff in the drive-through were working hard but they were like a chicken with her head cut off I guess there's not many people that want to work these days especially with the virus but it's getting a little more ridiculous when places are open but they don't have everything in place so that when you pull away from the drive-through you have what you need we didn't even have napkins and the straws were paper and completely started falling apart the minute we open them and try to use them in our drinks it was a little frustrating because my mom has some health issues and I couldn't go back
