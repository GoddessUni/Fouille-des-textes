This place seemed promising upon arriving in the parking lot as they not so subtly park their smoker out front. We came a bit after the peak lunch time so sadly they were out of the brisket. Between the three of us, my aunt, uncle and I opted to share an order of pulled pork and a full rack of baby back ribs, a couple sides of potato salad, cole slaw and fries and a fountain drink. We spent around $40 for the meal. Overall the flavors were not bad. The ribs were off the bone but also on the dry side. I wasn't crazy about the sauces offered and really only liked the sweet bbq sauce. Pulled pork was much better than ribs in my opinion. I felt like the portions could've been more for the $. Overall for it being connected to the mall I guess it's better than most offerings but I don't think I'd go out of my way to eat here.
