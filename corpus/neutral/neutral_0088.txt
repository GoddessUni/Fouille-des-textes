First of all, love that this place is paleo/gluten-free friendly! It's tucked in a shaded area of Magazine and stocks all sorts of goodies including salads. Next to where you order/the bakery corner is an area to sit (also inside), which is nice. 

The smoothies were awesome! We got the strawnana and Hawaiian flavors. The ingredients are awesomely just "fruit and ice" according to the person making them. However, not so nice is that they use frozen pre-made everything and just pop it in a magic bullet to freshen it up. I would think for $7/pop that we would get some fresh fruit (even if just part of the smoothie was fresh). 

Regarding the cookies... I am so sad! We got a spice and chocolate chip one. Honestly, I'm no baker - but definitely have some better gluten free recipes. I'm not sure what was off, but they tasted like flour. Perhaps we just got a bad batch? We would definitely give it another try if they change their cookie recipes.
