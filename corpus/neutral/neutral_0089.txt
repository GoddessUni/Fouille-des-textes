One of the things I have always liked about this place was that they had reusable plates, silverware and cups. Now, in a city that is stepping up to be a leader in earth friendliness by instituting a ban on straws, and next in line styrofoam and plastic bags, Burger Monger has gone in the opposite direction. Tonight we were greeted with plastic almost everything. They also gave us straws without asking. And the ketchup bottles can no longer be refilled because the caps are locked in place. Come on, BM, get with the program. I'd rather you charge me an extra .25 a burger for reusables than all this garbage from one meal.
