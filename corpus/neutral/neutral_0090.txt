Been here a few times since moving to the area, so enough to have formed an opinion. 

Pros: Great atmosphere, decently priced, good mix of people who are about my age.  Quizzo is really fun. Food comes out pretty quickly. 

Cons: Can't say I've been impressed with the wait staff. The first time, the waitress brought us our drinks. We were ready to order, but she said she'd be right back. After 30 minutes, the hostess finally came over and took our order. When the waitress came back 10 minutes after that, she paused at our table, looked confused at the lack of menus, and walked away without saying anything. 

The second time, sitting at the bar in the Oak room, all three of us wanted to order food. After taking the first order, the bartender abruptly walked away without asking if that was everything or giving the other two of us a chance to order. When she came back and we wanted to order too, she actually got mad at us because she'd already put the order in. Maybe don't walk away that quickly without saying anything? 

Overall, though, I like this place as a hangout spot, for Quizzo on Wednesday nights,  and to grab a beer with friends.
