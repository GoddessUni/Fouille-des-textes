This review is purely for the martinis.  All july they were having $3 or something ridiculously cheap martinis, but of course i didn't get back to nola until august...they kept it up, but just with $3 thursdays.  If you order the martinis on any other night they will be 3-4x the cost (i say 3-4 because it seemed to be more each time we'd go...inexplicably).  Also, the quality steadily declined.  First, the key lime martini was AWESOME.  the next time it was basicaly undrinkable, so i attribute that to a specific bartender.  After that time, i made specific instructions for the waitress to give the bartender--'make the key lime martini VERY sweet'. Still the quality continued to decline.  But for $3, its worth the risk...
