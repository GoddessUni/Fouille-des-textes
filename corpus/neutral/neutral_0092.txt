So I finally made it to the uptown location of this chain pizza joint...mostly because they mailed me a $10 off coupon and it was about to expire.

The service was sort of ridiculous. The staff seemed to be trying but they were just completely off their game. We had to ask for water refills (after rejecting my 1st 2 drinks...one because I was given an Arnold Palmer instead of an iced tea and then the iced tea because it tasted like a mix rather than brewed) and plates. They were slammed and apologized for the mis-steps.

The salads we had were yummy and the garlic knots with beer cheese were tasty. The pizza was more just meh. We had the Kosmic Karma and I was not a big fan of their pesto. 

We were seated downstairs because trivia was happening upstairs (and seemed to be really popular). The downstairs is pretty loud and it was crowded on this random Wednesday night.

Our floor show was watching people be confused by the 3 different doors that this space has...although only one is in use.
