Pretty good small noodle bar.  
We started with the caramelized onion rangoon.  It has a little tang to it, a good amount of onion taste, a pretty good crunch on the outside of the rangoon.

I tried two types of noodles.  The miso ramen was my favorite.  It is served with the pork shoulder, black garlic, and soft egg.  I added vegetables to get a bit of green in there.  The broth was pretty good after I added some spicy stuff to the dish, it had a little bit of the texture that I like from miso broth.  
I didn't like the brisket ramen as much as the miso, which surprised me after all of the praise for this dish.  The broth wasn't my favorite, I could have used a bit more heat and it has a bit too much of the tangy favor for my taste (perhaps it is a kimchi broth, but tangier than any kimchi jjigae that I've had).  Not bad, but I would prefer the miso.  The matzo ball was a pretty good texture with the soup.  I added egg and vegetable to this dish. 
For both of the dishes, the noodles were not my favorite.  Slightly under cooked, past the mark of al dente 

I tried an interesting gose beer with my meal that I hadn't tried before.  It was a blood orange gose.  Not bad.  

Service was pretty quick and friendly. 

This place gets packed pretty quickly.  There are only a few tables, with more seating at the bar.  

I have wavered between three and four stars with this review, but I think three is more accurate when comparing it to some of the other ramen bars in philly (which Cheu is really is much more of fusion than actual ramen, so maybe the comparison is not entirely accurate, but I think that the miso ramen is fairly traditional).
