I can't speak for the golf facilities as we were here to attend a wedding.  Thankfully, we only stayed one night. I would give it a 3.5 star review if I could (because the staff was awesome only) but not 4 stars for the clubhouse & hotel.  The building itself was dated & had a musty smell to it....carpeting, furniture, etc were in need of replacement.  Everything needed updated.  

Our hotel room was very spacious, but again, in need of updates & repairs.  A few holes in the walls from doorknob and towel hanger indentations.  Lots of cheap fixes to larger problems.  The doors to our balcony were damaged & wouldn't open.  Water pressure in the sink was nonexistent.  The furniture in the room again was old & dated. 

The pluses:  Our room was very clean.  The beds were comfortable. And the staff was very pleasant & helpful.  The views from the clubhouse were lovely.

My recommendation is that if you attend a gathering or wedding at this country club, best to seek nearby accommodations rather than staying here.
