The green salsa and fish tacos are telling me to brave the scene of young Mass Ave. hipsters. 

The atmosphere matters to me when I'm trying to enjoy dinner. This particular atmosphere was not for me on a weekend date night with my husband. It was loud, uncomfortable, and extremely crowded. If I was single and in my 20's it might be my cup of tea. It just felt a little more bar like than restaurant, and every time I find myself in a bar these days I end up leaving feeling older than 33.  I'm hoping we might be able to fix the atmosphere thing by checking it out during the week vs. on the weekend. I always have a much nicer time with lowered weeknight expectations than when the weekend hype is involved. If my plan works that three stars could definitely be a four.
