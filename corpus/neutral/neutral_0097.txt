I was genuinely excited to go to this beautifully decorated, sleek and beautiful finer dining Italian restaurant. However I ended up being sadly disappointed. We started out with cocktails that were served by a wonderful bartender, however, the calamari failed to live up to our expectations. It wasn't bad, just not what I would expect at a restsurant of this caliber. I ordered the black spaghetti with seafood in a red sauce and my boyfriend ordered the Beef Bolognese. We were both sorely disappointed. For the prices we paid for the dishes, I honestly felt like Olive Garden would have been a better choice. Overall, the reason this does not have a two-star review, is because of the fact that the decor was beautiful, and the service was fantastic. If it were not for these, I would have given two stars.
