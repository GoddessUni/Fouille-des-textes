I give Boathouse a 5 star for location and view, but really a 1 or 2 star for the food and service. The food was seriously lack-luster. We went for brunch and my husband and I both ordered the chilaquiles, and I got a short stack of pancakes on the side because #pregnancy. The chilaquiles were really quite bland, and I do recognize that I'm from Arizona where the mexican food is REAL mexican food, so I might be a bit spoiled, but it really wasn't good in general.

The pancakes were ok, but were a bit dry. I did, however, eat them all so I probably can't complain too much.

The service was pretty lack-luster. The guy who was supposed to be our server would walk around the tables acting like he was doing something, but then would just walk over to the corner and stand there with a menu in his hand talking to other servers. He made eye contact with us several times before we had even been asked for our drink orders, and it took us literally flagging him down to get him to come over. It also took quite a while for us to get our food - I'm talking like 30-40 minutes. It was a little ridiculous.

The view, though, is second to none. If we ever went back, I'd want to sit at the bar so I can get the full view of the ocean and the dog-friendly beach!
