I didn't think I'd being going to a plantation tour on my trip down South, nor did I really expect to enjoy it. Our tour guide was amazing. He was dressed in period clothing which I have to give him props for. And believe me, no one wants to wear heavy wool clothes in June in Nashville. 

As the tour progressed the guide explained the family tree which was mighty confusing. All I remember is one guy named his children with his second wife after his dead first wife! The actual home was decorated for a wedding from the Civil War era. They had a whole food spread along with a wedding cake and groom's cake. 

After touring the house, my friend and I walked around outside. They have some horses grazing, a gift shop, stables and what was the former slaves' home. They even have those fun cutouts to stick your head through for photos! Overall, the Belle Meade Plantation is well maintained and can be a fun stop for locals and tourists alike.
