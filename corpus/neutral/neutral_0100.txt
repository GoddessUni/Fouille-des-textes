We had gone here about a year ago and loved it.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere had a cool vibe.  Last night we were with a friend who has been there several times lately and we were all disappointed.   2 of us got the Shepherds pie and I had the fish and chips. Maybe we have high standards since we have had these dishes in Ireland but my fish was mushy inside the crisp coating.  The Shepherds pie had mystery veggies in it ,red sauce and cheese in the potato topping! There is some times a reason recipes last hundreds of years. Well now we know where to get shepards pie and it's not here!
