In the beginning service was excellent. We were immediately seated and offered a free appetizer which was tasty. Not sure of the name but it was similar to pico de Gallo on top of a tortilla chip with cheese. We ordered the vegetarian samosa, malai kofta saag, neeligiri vegetable korma, and garlic naan. All were very delicious. And they serve you plenty. So I decided to order one of there cocktails. I think it was the blue lagoon. It was pretty gross. I Tasted like straight syrup. After only taking Couple sips I asked one of the waiters if i could switch it out for a beer. Which they did. At the end the brought our bill which initially was 34.96. I then told her I had a groupon. She took my phone and the bill to make the adjustment. After doing so she bring everything back and it appears she changed the amount to 38.96 by charging me for both drinks without even mentioning it. Not sure if it was because I had the groupon or what. Not a total deal breaker but I thought it was ridiculous especially since I didn't even drink it. All in all food was really good
