Stopped in for lunch.  Nice place, very friendly staff.  Not very big.  Had to wait for a table only because they dont have many.  Sits right on the river, real nice view and you can see the local park on the other side. Food was ok.  I had the hamburger steak topped with cheese, baked potatoe and salad bar.  The steak was real small, just a hamburger patty covered in cheese and onions.  Well done and bland.  Baked Potatoe was very good.  Cooked just right.  Salad bar was very small and few options.  I look forward to going back for dinner and trying something else.  all in all just nothing to get excited about except for the view.
