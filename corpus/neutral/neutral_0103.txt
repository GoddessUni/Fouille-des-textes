Let me preface this by saying that Panera Bread is usually one of my favorite restaurants.  I've been to this location twice since it opened.  The first was on their grand opening when corporate was still there, so to judge it from that would be misleading.  However, on my most recent visit I was a little disappointed. 

 Panera always has small portions and normally, I'm fine with it, but this last visit to this location I felt robbed.  There were two of us and we both got the you-pick-two.  The salad was less than a handful of lettuce, chicken, and toppings and the cup of soup was half of the cup it was in.  A quick look around the room showed that it seemed like everyone's portions were smaller than usual.  

The quality of the food was Panera standards, I just felt as though they weren't giving adequate portions in comparison with other Panera Breads that I have been to.
