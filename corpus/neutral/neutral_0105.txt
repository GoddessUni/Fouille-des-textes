Sometimes you just can't be elite. 

Sometimes you just need some good biscuits. 

A little proper perspective here, I mean after all it's a Bob Evans. It's basic. It's not going to blow you away. Heck, it might not always be the cleanest when you show up. But I've seen far worse. 

I think it's said best if you compare this place with like minded places. 

Is Bob Evans better than a locally owned diner? It depends. If a locally owned place is doing it right, Bob Evans can't touch that experience. But I've been in some divers where I wished I had gone to a Bob Evans instead. 

Is Bob Evans better than a Denny's? Depends on what you order. Some things that Denny's makes can't be duplicated. Some things can easily be better. 

Is Bob Evans better than Cracker Barrel? Based on what I've eaten breakfast wise there compared to here, the answer is a resounding yes. Bob does it better than Cracker Barrel. 

Is Bob Evans better than a Waffle House... wait, that's unfair. Nothing is better than a Waffle House. 

Bob gets some love based on some items that are just better than comparable items. You can pretty much guarantee a good plate of sausage and gravy here. And the biscuits are better than KFC, and maybe even Popeyes. 

Oh no, he didn't go there....

Oh yes he did!
