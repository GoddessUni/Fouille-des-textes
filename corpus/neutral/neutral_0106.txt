I don't know why I keep coming back here. It's mediocre in general, but I like to fiddle with my phone on wifi while I eat if I'm alone, so...I guess that's why.

Today I went in for lunch. I ordered a chicken quesadilla to start, then a burger with fries and an iced tea. The waiter was just...okay. I mean, he didn't do anything inherently wrong during my meal, but he was less than attentive. Generally every visit to my table was a fly-by which tends to annoy me, but I sort of shrugged it off.

However...

When my check came, it was itemized down the right side with a total of $21.75. I left $25.00 because a 15% tip seemed pretty fair for an okay waiter.

A minute after taking the cash, he whipped around the corner and approached me. "Was there something wrong with your service?" "Uh, what?" "It's just that you tipped less than ten percent, was something wrong with your service?"

It turns out that there was ANOTHER total on my check on the left side that was my actual total, a few bucks more. Now on the one hand I was glad to tip the percentage I had intended, and genuinely sorry to have not done so in the first place.

On the other hand though...what a dick move. I mean. I get it. Being a daytime waiter can suck. You want to make your coins, and I respect that. But isn't it generally accepted in waiterville that if you get stiffed on a tip, you suck it up? Isn't it considered pretty much the most obnoxious thing ever to get in a customer's face about your tip? Basically what you're saying is "I think I deserve more money than what you gave me." And it's not your call, dude.

So anyway, the food was the typical 'fine', the atmosphere was the same pseudo trendy hipster blah as always. I'm just torn on how to respond to this waiter's decision to get up in my face.
