Good location for a primarily business hotel.

Rooms are modern in design and decently-sized.

Nice touches: apples at front desk, complimentary deluxe continental breakfast (with potatoes and eggs every morning), complimentary wine-and-cheese each evening, with two samples per guest. The automated De Houtte beverage machine is fun, but don't expect it to produce an award-winning latte.

Some downsides, however.

Limited parking, covered but still outdoors. (Not ideal for -40 degrees!)

Picky about late check-out, they told me "1 p.m. at the latest," which was okay - until they advised me I still had to move my car by noon to the pay lot next door!

As a business hotel, minimal amenities with a tiny fitness centre carved out of two guest rooms, and a surprisingly small business centre.

Overall, not bad, but certainly not a vacation spot.
