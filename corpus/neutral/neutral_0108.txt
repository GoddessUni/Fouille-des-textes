I would give it 4 stars if they had a manager with a brain. Kids were in town so we stopped there for lunch since they have a kids menu.
Makes sense right? We had 2 strollers and the manager says the strollers aren't allowed inside the restaurant. Really? He said it's a fire ordinance in Philly. Well, we are in Ardmore, but I didn't go into that.
 Can we put the strollers in the closet area? NO. Once again this idiot manager said there was no room for strollers. Between the waitress and myself we figured we could park the strollers outside in the little courtyard. The manager couldn't offer that as a solution, but then he doesn't seem like the brightest bulb in the box.
Very good mac and cheese, good salads and the service was great. The waitress kept saying she was sorry and she didn't get why the manager wasn't more helpful. More people came in with strollers and they put theirs by the reception stand, which seemed ok with the manager.
Go for the food, but if you have little ones beware the stroller issue.
