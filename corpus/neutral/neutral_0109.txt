I brought my daughter here for lunch. I was impressed by the look of the place and I wanted to try everything on the menu! I started with roasted brussels sprouts with pork belly drizzled with a sweet chili sauce. It was perfect, I mean, "give me that recipe" kind of perfect.  I ordered chicken pho for my daughter and a special of broiled cod for myself.  The pho was very fragrant, overwhelmingly, and almost inedibly so.  My daughter added the chili sauce and brown sauce, which made it more palatable. The presentation of the cod was beautiful, but it was slightly under cooked, and the flavor was bland.  I realized that the same sweet chili sauce that was on my sprouts, was on my fish, over my rice and my salad.  It wasn't bad, but I felt like I was eating sweet chili sauce four ways.  We waited a VERY long time for the check after requesting it, and it seemed that once other tables were seated that maybe my server was overwhelmed and forgot about it.  I saw this restaurant while shopping at the ski shops few weeks prior, and I traveled about 30 minutes to get there on this visit.  I wouldn't drive 30 minutes for a return visit.
