After hours of searching thru yelp and other online tools, searching for a breakfast, we found this place toward the East side, not sure exactly where. I can't really comment on what the area was like, as I've never been there before. However we walked in, the staff were very inviting and kind. 

We were invited to sit where ever we wanted and the waitress came and took over pretty quickly. It was not a very fancy place, but the chips and salsa were absolutely delicious. I'm not sure if it was because I was starving at this point, after all we had been looking for breakfast and it was by now 2:30 p.m. . There was a generous amount of vegetarian options available and they were very kind to make adjustments to accommodate what we had wanted. 

The vegetarian burrito was bigger HUGE and all of our food came out very generously proportioned and quite tasty. Thank you for feeding some starving and lost vegetarians and having great options on your menu.
