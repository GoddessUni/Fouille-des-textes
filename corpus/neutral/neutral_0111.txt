First off, the food we had was great. Loved the crab, they were seasoned and cooked well.  I liked the papered tables and being able to smash the crab with a wooden mallet.  My girlfriend raved about the mussels. Oddly,the steamed little-neck clams arrived in a foiled-over, green plastic bucket that small children might use to play at the beach. The clams were clean and fresh though, so I can't really complain.    

That being said, Lestardo's was perhaps one of the filthiest places I've eaten in a long time. I like a good dive, but this... The men's room was absolutely foul. It looked, and smelled, like it hadn't been cleaned in a long, long, long while. Luckily the door closed tight so that the smell didn't bleed out into the dining room.  The dining room in general screams of neglect and needs a whole lot of TLC. If not for these issues, I would have given 4 stars. 

At the end of the day, the food WAS good though. Based on that alone, I might very well go back to give them another shot. Hopefully by then they'll at least use a bit of old fashioned elbow-grease and clean up a bit. This place could be great if they give the dining room some much needed TLC.
