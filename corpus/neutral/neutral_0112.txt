Pizza was good enough that I would do take out in the future. Dining in wasn't the best experience. All of the girls that were working were super friendly however the guy that took our order seemed completely uninterested in helping us whatsoever. No greeting just a blank stare. Super awkward. There was also very limited seating. They have a back room with tables but everyone of them had dirty dishes on them so we ended up sitting at a pub table crammed in the middle of the room.  So I won't be taking the family to dine in anytime soon, however if I were a college kid this would be my first stop after a night out partying!
