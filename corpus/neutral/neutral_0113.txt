Texas Roadhouse is the type of place where you get decent food, good service and  your money's worth.  However, it's not the type of place where you rave about your meal and dream about going back ASAP.

Every one I've been to looks exactly the same---very cookie cutter.  Plus every one I've been to is always crowded and very noisy.   The dining experience starts like this --- you open the door and then worm your way to the host/hostess station.  Once there (more often than not) you are told that there is a wait for a table.  You are given a piece of paper with a number on it, sent to the waiting area where you watch an electronic display to see when your number comes up.  Most of the time, the waiting area is jam packed and overflowing.  Your number appears and once again, you have to worm your way up to the host/hostess station.  While s/he gathers up menus, you have to deal with people saying "excuse me" as they, too, have to worm their way someplace---either to the waiting area, the host/hostess station or outside.

Usually service is fairly prompt.  I'll give them this---they have a great soft drink selection---sweetened iced tea (one of my favorites) and recently, a cherry limeade (very tasty!).  The rest of the menu items are good---no complaints at all there.  Once again, predictable no matter where the location.

So...in conclusion...it's not the place to go for gourmet steaks nor is it the place to go for a quiet meal.  As long as you know what to expect---and don't mind it all---you'll do just fine.
