I came here once not too long after they opened for lunch with my husband and daughter. It was later in the lunch hour--1:30 or so, and there weren't too many people there. It took some time for anyone to give us menus or take our drink orders. While we perused the menu, we saw three tables who'd been there when we got there finally get their food; all three immediately boxed it and left. They were clearly people there on their lunch hour who had to go and had been waiting way too long. We waited for some time for our food too, and our daughter's meal came well after ours, which is a little backwards...she's only 2, so I'd have preferred to wait to get my food until all was ready, as toddlers don't understand "it's coming!" The food was good, but mine was cold. The server was pretty unapologetic for his lack of attention and was quick to tell us how busy they've been and how understaffed...that may well be the case, and as someone who's waited tables, I totally feel his pain, but we were there when it was no longer busy and it didn't seem to affect things. 

Not long after this, my husband ordered carryout from Zapp. They told him 45 minutes. He went after 45 minutes and they hadn't even started cooking it yet. For this place to survive, they're going to have to step it up a lot.


****editing to add a star. Went back for lunch today and had much better service.
