After a nice dinner, kids wanted ice cream and since we were on Decatur where this place is located we made it our dessert stop.  The ice cream shop is like a nice and big candy shop with pralines, candy apples, and all kinds of chocolates plus ice cream.  You can sample ice cream flavors and pick a waffle cone or cup.  Kids got the Superman which is like a type of colorful sherbet flavor not my type, New Orleans praline which is more my type but it didn't taste like anything I have not had and the Kilwins flavor which my son was ok with.  Overall a nice place but I don't think is anything too special about it.
