From the outside, it looks a little janky, but the food was actually pretty good.
My mother is Hispanic and she came along for supper tonight, and she stated some of the dishes were "authentic" Mexican dishes (the tamales, the flautas). We were both a little confused/interested in the brown sauce covering the enchiladas, as it was almost sweet. Our server said it was the way it was prepared in their region of Mexico. It wasn't bad, just very different from the "normal" red sauce.  We both agreed the rice and ground beef in the tacos needed salt, but as I said, the food was pretty good. 
The restaurant itself was clean, and the staff was friendly.
