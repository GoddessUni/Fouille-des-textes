Pizza is always a good idea especially on a cold rainy night in February. 

Our food was done faster than the estimated time frame. The bread sticks were nice and crispy. The cheese sauce was room temperature. The pizza was not thoroughly cooked. Some slices were crispier than others. 

The toppings were good quality. I love pizza that is made with the cheese covering the main toppings. I ordered for carry out and they have a convenient pick up window. The staff was polite and not frustrated that I ordered so close to the end of the night. Next time I plan to dine-in so I can experience the food right after it's been cooked.
