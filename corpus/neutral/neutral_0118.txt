Modern Indian BYO under the benevolent dominion of Marcie Turney and Valerie Safran. Don't come here expecting authentic Indian, because you will be disappointed if you do. Instead, just embrace the "flavors of India" and don't think too much about authenticity.  

Thali Tuesdays! Every Tuesday, Bindi offers a $20 prix fixe meal called a Thali which, Bindi informs us, is a complete meal that offers a sampling of small Indian dishes. You have the choice of your entree among a meat, a fish, or a vegetarian option. It comes with a paratha, raita, chutney, dal, a vegetable dish, a pickle dish, rice, and a salad chaat -- all of which change weekly -- on a giant wooden plate. 

When we went, I got the tapioca-crusted arctic char, which was yums. Most side dishes were not memorable, but I did very much enjoy the beet chaat and the punjabi-style cabbage that accompanied my fish. I know others ordered the malabar spiced skirt steak, which was also a palette-pleaser. 

We also tried the Warm Cardamom Cake for dessert. The cake itself was wonderful (you can't really go wrong with cardamom, ever), but it came with a very aggressively flavored 'Indian spiced chocolate pot de creme' and salted sugar glass that attacked my tastebuds-- I don't really know if that's what they were going for but I would not order it again.

All in all, though, it was a nice meal, especially for the special Thali price. Bindi takes reservations by phone, so that makes it more convenient.
