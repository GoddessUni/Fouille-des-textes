I tried to go to Primo's across the street but they were closed so thought I would give this joint another shot.  Last time I was there we ordered a cheesesteak and sub.  I remember thinking the cheesesteak was huge but not enough cheese and the cheese was on the bottom not mixed in with the meat.  Also remembered not being impressed with the sub.  On the menu there is a regular sub and a special sub.  I asked the difference and was told a special is like an Italian sub and regular is American.  Not sure why the special isnt called an Italian but whatever.  So I ordered it.  Also ordered a pepperoni and cheese stromboli.   The sub sucked.  The bread didn't taste fresh. Also had giant chunks of onion on it.  No Italian ham or salami.  Not sure how an Italian sub can not have salami?? wt???  It was prov, cappacola and regular boiled ham.  Will not ever get again.  Sub gets no stars from me but my boyfriend enjoyed his sub.  I do think the stromboli was very good.  I will definatly go back to try the pizza based on the stromboli but no more subs.  Will also get a cheesesteak again but get extra cheese for sure.
