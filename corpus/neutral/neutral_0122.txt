People always rave about the Highlevel Diner but I just don't understand the hype.  I went for lunch on a Saturday, I had to wait for a table, and when I finally got seated, it was a table smooshed up against a wall (walls on two sides of the table).  The cream for coffee sits on the table in a cute little china cream dish.  I thought it was incredibly charming until I poured it into my coffee and it came out in chunks.  
Our server didn't smile once.  It might have been because we asked what the soup and sandwich of the day were and she had to trek into the kitchen to find because she didn't know.  
Aside from all of that, the food was good.  I enjoyed my lunch and so did my lunch date.  The portions are huge - at least mine was.  I was only able to eat about half of the food on my plate and I was starving when I sat down to eat.  I guess I'm one of those people who wants an experience - not just good food.  I was really disappointed because I have always heard amazing things about the Highlevel Diner.  I wish I could have experienced it for myself.  The hassle to find parking just wasn't worth it for a mediocre time.
