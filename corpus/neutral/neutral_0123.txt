I have to say, I saw this before the renovation, and I still like the new one but not as much as the old layout.

I remember subsisting on the chicken sandwiches here for a week when the food carts were mysteriously absent from campus for a bit in one summer. And the 24-7 store also was my favorite place to pick up some Wawa Peach or Green Iced Tea in the half-gallon size.

You have touch-screens now to make your food.

Oh, the hot dogs - only so-so. The make-your-own slushie, very good.

The fruit salad and breakfast foods never really appealed to me, but the pretzels were cheap in the morning.

A place to grab a quick bite to eat. And some other random supplies for college students.
