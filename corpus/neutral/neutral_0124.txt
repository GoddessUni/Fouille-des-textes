I took my 6 year old son here and we both had a great 2 hours for $20.  There are plenty of games with different skill levels and the prizes they will win are on par or slightly better than Chucky Cheese prizes.  As far as video games, if you want to play a modern looking game, expect to pay 4 tokens.  Most games that you want to play cost at least 2 tokens.  Old games like pacman, galaga, and slightly newer like Simpsons arcade game are 1 token.  The bright spot is that $20 gives you 100 tokens, so it works out.  We will definitely visit again on our next trip down here.
