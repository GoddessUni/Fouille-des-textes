I wish that I could love this place. I really do. Week after week, in the pages of US Weekly I see celebrities digging into a nice cup of Pinkberry.

Well, now that a store has opened up in SB, I decided to finally try it out. I ordered a medium regular yogurt with toppings. It cost $4.95, and they allow 3 toppings with that price. I got strawberry, raspberries, and chocolate chips.  Now- the big problem I had here is that the yogurt is bland.

Yes, bland, bland, bland. And the toppings are kept cold, so I almost got a brain freeze while eating this. My date got a small pomegranate yogurt, which cost $4.95 and included 2 toppings. Yes, the pomegranate costs $1 more (for a smaller size). He seemed to enjoy it.

I will go back to McConnell's, for some real ice-cream. This is probably good stuff for those thin gals who could never imagine eating real ice-cream, but I like thick and creamy McConnell's.
