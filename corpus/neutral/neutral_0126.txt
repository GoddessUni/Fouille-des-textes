We have come here fairly often and usually have decent food and decent service.  We stopped in tonight as it was Hubbys birthday, service by Haley was horrendous.  After we ordered drinks and they were delivered, had to ask for a glass with the beer and Splenda for the ice tea, we waited at least 10 min for these to show up and glass was warm, I asked her if they do chilled glasses and she said they were out, REALLY!!!, this is a bar restaurant, all you need to do is run a wet glass into the ice chest to get it cold.  Food was good as usual, not outstanding but good.  You really need to redo that Cole slaw recipe though, gross.  I would have spoken to a manager if I had seen anyone who looked older than 25.  Waitresses need to be told that hanging out together at the desk is not how it's done.
