This is just your run of the mill shopping center Mexican resteraunt. They have everything gringos want: burritos, tacos, and free chips and salsa. The food prices are decent, but they get you on the alcohol. However their margs are pretty good so it's worth it. They have made to order guacamole that is made right at the side of your table on a guac cart. So that is pretty neat, adds a little entertainment to your meal. They have a bar section so you can escape those people who bring everyone from great great mamaw to their cousins sisters boyfriends niece. 

There are worse places you could eat at like long john silvers, T.G.I. Fridays, prison... just to name a few. If your looking to have your mind blown by a ground beef hard shell taco, this isn't your place. If your looking to eat decent Mexican food that won't leave you sick (lookin at you T Bell) then stop on in next time your on county line road. Which hopefully you aren't....
