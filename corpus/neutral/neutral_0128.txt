My visit to Punk Burger was a few weeks ago. While my compadres previously dined here (without me), this was my first trip.  Now I was ready to try the burger with fried mozzarella, or the special jalape√±o burger, but I decided to keep it simple my first trip; just to see how things shaped up, so the "BIG MAN ON CAMPUS" was my burger of choice. Meat stuffed, and topped with cheese, their double garlic insanity bacon, red onion, and of course lettuce and tomato. 

The burger was good, the fries were okay, but overall I was quite satisfied with the product I was consuming. I've heard so much about Punk Burger, and I have to say I am glad I had the opportunity to dine there. Pretty much it's just another burger joint. While the food was good it really doesn't stand out.  However, I vow to have a shake with my next visit, yes there will be another visit.
