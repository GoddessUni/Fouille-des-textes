Bought a groupon for this restaurant because the reviews were good.  The restaurant has a nice vibe.  The outdoor courtyard seating was nice.  Ordered the calamari, gator bites, crab cakes, and the jambalaya.  I thought the food was average.  I really wasn't impressed by any of the dishes.  The gator bites (regular sausage) and jambalaya were tasty.  I didn't like the crab cakes at all.  I prefer lot soft crab in my crab cakes.  These crab cakes were kinda mushy.  Lots of breading and other stuff that took away from the crab.  The calamari was a little too salty for me, but ok once dipped in the sauce.  Don't think i would come back here again if ever in New Orleans.
