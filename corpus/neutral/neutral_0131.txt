I was craving a good cupcake so I read the reviews here and realized I could get this from whole foods. I have never tried any of amaru's baked goods before. I got the salted caramel chocolate cupcake and the one with white cake and lavender colored frosting with a stamped white sugar square (can't remember name of it) the reason I gave 3 out of 5 stars is the cake itself was heavy, thick and moist which I thought was great  but it only had some flavor and the frosting we didn't think had much flavor at all. My husband and I both tried each cupcake and didn't think it was that great. I wanted to like this but it just wasn't for us. Sorry Amaru,  we may try other flavors in the future but not too impressed with these two cupcakes.
