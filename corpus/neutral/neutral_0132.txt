Trendy space with what looks like a rich history. The servers are attentive to filling glasses and the menu has a traditional feel to it. Everything was on track to having an awesome meal.
There were five of us and a plethora of appetizers were ordered for the table. Calamari had a lite batter and came with lemon and cocktail sauce however was slightly overdone. Next the goat cheese torte wasn't overbearing and had a pretty good flavor. We also had grilled artichokes which were my favorite. It looked like they had a creamy balsamic sauce that worked well with the artichoke hearts. We also had bacon wrapped grilled shrimp which was overcooked. I decided to try the special of roast chicken lasagna. It was sheets of lasagna stuffed with cheese and chicken with a white sauce then topped with a basil sauce. Both texture and flavor were one note. It seemed like the sauce was nearly identified except basil and garlic were added.  It needed some grilled mushrooms or red peppers to give it intrigue.
It was an okay experience.
