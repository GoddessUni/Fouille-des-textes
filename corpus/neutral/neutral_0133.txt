Our table ordered the pigs ears just for the novelty of the dish. It was really good surprisingly! My only complaint about it was the sauce it came with was not gluten free. 
The entrees weren't very big but tasty nonetheless. I got the sirloin flap but I would have liked to a little more. My business partners all got the ribeye which was plenty since you could order the amount you wanted. 
I would have liked to see a tab bit more healthy options to go along with the rich food but then again, I may have left even hungrier!
