I was looking up places on Yelp to buy a gift for my grandmother, whom basically has every type of gift you can buy for her already purchased. The word "popcorn" came into my mind, so one thing lead to another and I ended up hopping on the sub and coming here. 

I got her the chedder popcorn, which cost somewhere around $15.

As for the quality of popcorn, it tasted like regular cheddar popcorn, except it has a whole bunch of cheese on it. The price was also a bit steep, considering that the can was maybe 7 inches tall, and 4 inches wide. But, the cheddar was rich and did not have that plasticy taste most popcorn has.
