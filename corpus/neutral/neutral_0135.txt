Went to brunch here on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. I was worried it might be crowded since we did not have a reservation but it was relatively empty and we were seated at a high top near the bar area. It is a cute space and the staff seemed nice. My friend and I have similar tastes so we both ordered the French Onion Soup and the Caesar salad. French Onion soup was good. Nothing special but not horrible either. The Caesar salad was not for me. It had a little too much of the fresh peeled Piave cheese and coupled with the creamy dressing was a lot of dairy on top of romaine. I might go back to this restaurant if I was in the area and try something besides the salad. I remember the brunch specials sounding good and perhaps should have given them a try instead.
