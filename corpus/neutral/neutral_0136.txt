The food here was great, got the buffalo cauliflower which I would highly recommend. Then the veggie black bean burger which was also great! The only down side to this place is the terrible service. I asked for a side of sauce and the waitress just walked over to the bar got on her phone and then 5 minutes later got it what I asked for. I barely saw our waitress and had to ask other servers for things. It's a shame that a staff can ruin such a good restaurant... this isn't the first time this place was known for terrible service.
