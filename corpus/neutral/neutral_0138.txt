I had really looked forward to this place but was a bit disappointed in the long run. I did like the vibe there. They have big fun pieces of artwork on the walls and tables are spaced well. You could tell it was a neighborhood hangout for a few people. They had happy hour 4-7 so I did get my drink at a discount. Speaking of drinks I had one of their special cocktails served in a French press! A tad on the sour side but kept me from drinking it too fast. The real disappointment was my burger. It had a flavor I didn't care for at all. Kinda like my moms meatloaf which as a kid I wouldn't eat. I paid $15 just for burger and sweet potato fries - which if I loved it no problem.
