It has been a very long time since we last dined at Aldo's.  We moved back to the area not too long ago and  for many many years Aldo's was our go to place prior to our move.  I was looking forward to trying it once again.  Besides we are seeking out a new "go to pizza" place.  I don't remember Aldo's pizza being doughy, limp and lack luster.  I really wanted to say "wow" in a good way but my "wow" was met with "hmmm...not as good as I remember".  We had half a pizza left over and surprisingly it was actually better after I re-heated it at 400 degrees in my own oven.  Maybe it came out of the pizza oven too early at the restaurant?  The service was excellent...friendly and efficient wait staff.  A woman (manager?) stopped at our table to make sure everything was good.  We liked that special care.  The dinners around us looked like generous portions and fresh salads. We like a byob and the hostess was quick to offer opening our bottle.  The dining room has a nice cozy feel and soft music playing in the background.  I appreciate when we can have a conversation without having to shout to hear each other.  The menu is extensive.  I never quite get why a smaller restaurant has a massive menu? It was nice to see every table occupied on a Saturday night.
