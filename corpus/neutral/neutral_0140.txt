Given the fact that I expected Chinese food like I get in the mall's food court, I was pleasantly surprised by their dishes. 

Ordered in once when I was too lazy to cook or even leave the house (yes, winter was cruel). Had the chicken and cashew, some ribs and a vegetable dish (mixed vegetables w/tofu). I thought it was pretty tasty! 

Ribs were marinated and cooked nicely, the chicken and cashew was tasty enough and they were generous with the veg dish. It had several types of vegetables and plenty of tofu. 

Lady on the phone wasn't too friendly, but I think you can't really expect too much for the price. Dinner was delivered in 45 min to my apartment door. 

I will definitely consider them again in one of my lazy moods, especially because KoP doesn't have many good places that deliver.
