Egg white cups are fun! I get them often for breakfast but they're a bit unsatisfying and overly cheesy so I end up just wanting more food without feeling like I've eaten a good breakfast. I'm sad they stopped selling ancient grains oatmeal. 

I've gotten oatmeal from here a few times because it's right next to my first class of the day every day, but their toppings bar is rather limited and everything is sugared up and sweetened except the strawberries and almonds, and they often fill their oatmeal cups to the brim so it's hard to add a substantial amount of toppings. 

Cosi bread is THE BEST. My friend and I used to come here just because their multigrains are so yummy (and their plains have the same oniony? but not oniony? flavored awesomeness that goes with every meal you could get). If you get a warm slice it totally makes your day.

Their turkey avocado sandwich is *very* filling! Great for togo lunches when you're powering through your day, but it still just tastes like fast food. 

Service is consistently prompt, with on-and-off friendly cashiers. Some places you can walk into knowing you'll have really sweet service but here.

High music volume + the types of food is too fast-foody for me to say it's a fantastic place to go if you have your choice of time constraints, but it's healthy enough for a good, quick lunch.
