Went in for some wings to-go and wow..... was very surprised to see that they are NOT a full bar and only offer beer and wine? UGH.... No big deal though we only wanted to-go anyway. Wondering if they maybe had their liquor license taken away as it states everywhere that they are a full bar? 

Food was fast and came out very hot, was still hot when we got it home! Everything seems to be all good so far but the place was a bit dead so hopefully we do not get sick or anything crazy like that as seen in the below reviews! 

The bartenders were nice that waited on us but we did notice a bunch of kids hanging out at the bar hanging with the staff and I noticed one of the girls washing a huge bucket of silverware by hand which I don't know is code as I always thought they went through a sanitary dish washer?

Anyways.... we went to this one due to being down the road on cross creek but will def not be back and probably go to the one next time on bruce b downs that is next to bonefish that seems to be always packed!
