I've been here twice in the last month, and it was good both times. I wouldn't say I was wowed and I wouldn't say I was disappointed. Everything was good without being great. Nothing tastes especially authentic, but it was all well prepared and at decent prices. Our server was the same guy both times, and he was attentive and friendly.

I had enchiladas the first time, fajitas the second time, and they were good. The chips and salsa both taste fresh. 

The place is in a sort of notorious location at 116th Street and Allisonville Road that used to also be a Mexican restaurant that I liked a lot. This one is decorated much differently and has more of the feel of a upscale fusion place. If I had wanted to be brave and delve deeper into the menu, I'm pretty sure I would have found stuff more along those lines. So this place might be better for the younger set looking to try more new things and explore that which has never been explored before. Me, I'll just take enchiladas with salad, guac and sour cream, thanks.
