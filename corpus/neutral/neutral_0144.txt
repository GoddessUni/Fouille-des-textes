As another reviewer said, not your typical Hyatt. I stayed here when my group travelled to UCSB for a series of 3 day meetings. It was quite nice, old fashioned which had its charm. There were about 20 of us and we requested to be near each other and we made the reservations like 3 months in advance. So what happens, one of us got put in another building. Very annoying. And the other thing, to get to the 3rd floor, you have to go to the 2nd floor, get off the elevator, go a long hallway then get into another elevator to the 3rd floor.  Oh and, you get off the elevator and you have a few stairs before the hallway. I was like, what the heck? Really not convenient when you're dragging your luggage. No bellhop to help. You gotta haul your luggage.

Dinner was served for the whole group and catered by the hotel. They had 3 waiters assigned to us and each time after they served the course, they hung around chit chatting on some corner, not paying attention to the group. I had to wave my arms profusely to get their attention, each time, for anything ie water refill for the table, new fork, person on another table is suppose to get vegetarian, got something else, etc. They were totally inattentive. I was not impressed.

The hotel had a nice bar - Bistro something. $5 happy hour drinks.

On the plus side, close proximity to beach - but it was cold all three days we were there, nice sized room and comfy.
