Hotel was very clean, maid service was on point. Rooms were nice with plenty of room, big tv, comfortable beds and clean bathrooms. If you don't plan on doing much inside the hotel then its a perfect stay.
Some of the big negatives though is definitely the price of parking. Roughly $45 a day is ridiculous. The food at Bar 13 was absolutely terrible. Didn't know a steak salad could be that poorly executed.  The drink selection was actually very very good but the service was entirely to slow. Took me and my wife around 20 minutes to get a beer and bloody mary when there wasn't many people at the bar at all.
