I'm going to start this review with the good ones: chargrilled oysters, fried half and half platter (half fish, half fried oysters) and jambalaya! 
The CHARGRILLED OYSTERS is the best oyster dish that i had in NOLA; it's salty, cheesy, buttery with a smoky after taste! You could never go wrong with this dish. It comes with bread to dunk into the salty, buttery sauce. Definitely dangerous for the arteries, but DEFINITELY WORTH IT.
The fried half and half was delicious too. The fried oysters were good (super fresh!) And the fish has this tender and delicate taste that is perfect when you dip it into the tartar sauce.
The JAMBALAYA was smoky, has the perfect amount of salt, good rice consistency. It goes perfectly with the fried oysters and fish that we ordered! 

My sister in law ordered the half and half PO BOY (half shrimp, half oysters). There's nothing special about it and the sauce is mediocre. So if you're looking for the best Po Boy in NOLA, go somewhere else.
The GUMBO was okay. It's a little too fishy for me though.

The service was good but not extraordinary either. And my main concern is how they serve the RAW OYSTERS which luckily, we didn't order.
I saw this girl opening the oysters put the order receipt ON TOP of the half opened raw oysters that they were about to serve! Yes, it's very very unsanitary. I actually observed her for about 15 minutes because I was thinking that maybe, she did that absentmindedly. But after opening a second batch of oysters and put it in the plate, guess what? She put the receipt (which came from god knows where) on top of the plate again!

I would still definitely recommend everyone to try their grilled oysters. It's simply one of the best. Find a better Po boy somewhere else though. And if you're planning to order the raw oysters, watch them prepare it for you and make sure they're not putting the receipt on top of it!
