This is the first time I have eaten here. The main reason for the 3 star rating was the poor service and the other was attention to detail. I ordered the Beef Fajitas but when it was delivered I never saw the waitress until I was almost done. When I placed my order she didn't mention they were out of avocado until later. I wasn't given any credit. Another problem was I had to ask if there was any Hot Sauce that came with the Fajitas. She said, "Oh yes. It's suppose to come with the order. Would you like sour cream also?" Duh, I wondering why I've eaten more than half my meal before I finally get to see my waitress and get the condiments that were suppose to come with my meal. Most of the time, my waitress spent behind the cash register, pretty much separating herself from the customers except certain ones. I had ice tea for a drink. Even though I had finished it waiting for my food, I was never offered a refill.

The Beef Fajitas were good but were dry because of no condiments. The whole beans tasted more like a chili. It wasn't until I was ready to leave that management and the waitress began to come over to my table to see if there was anything else I needed. Before this management and the staff seemed to focus most of their attention on other tables who were either regulars or spoke their language (sorry just what I observed and heard).
