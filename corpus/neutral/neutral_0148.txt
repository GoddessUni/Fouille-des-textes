Mojo smoothie bowls are delicious, vibrant, beautiful, and healthy; a breath of fresh air to the beignets/alligator/fried chicken stronghold that Nola is better known for. So why the low rating?

Though the bowls were AMAZING, we waited an hour for 2 bowls because there was an issue or something with the blender + either nobody realized it or they forgot and didn't follow up on my orders. When they finally realized it only after I went up to check, it still took an extra 30 minutes to make. Yes I can make these bowls myself and yes I might be complaining about an off-day issue and sure, I could have cancelled my order or "why don't you make it yourself" but the point is "yes I can make it myself but I'm on vacation and I came here for something healthy and quick without having to waste time doing it myself" and they're beautiful but not van Gogh smoothie bowls so they shouldn't take so long to make, even with the "equipment malfunction" (which was totally working because they had an open kitchen where the bowls were made) and I was waiting there the entire time.
