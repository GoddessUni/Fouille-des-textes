Appetizer:  The beef empanada is tasty and is a good portion size.  The spinach & ricotta empanada is ok tasting.  The chicken empanada is dry and tasteless, I don't recommend it.    
Entree:  Do try the Churrasco de Entrana if you are a steak fan, it's delicious.  I would not recommend the Classic Milanesa chicken, it's a large piece of chicken that's flattened and fried, nothing special.    
For dessert, the creme brulee is good. 
I've giving 3 stars because the service is really slow.  On the other hand if you come in a big party, you will get preferential treatment by the servers, if you come as a couple, expect not to see your server for about 30 minutes after you place your order, sip your drink because you likely won't get a refill for a long time.
