Okay so this place has awesome snowballs! The ice is soft and they put a lot of juice! Only bad thing is that the wait time is ridiculous. I've walked in here plenty of times and wasn't even acknowledged that I was waiting about 30 mins to place an order bc all the girls were busy with other orders. They are not organized at all. I feel like every worker here should have one job only instead of doing everything at once and being all over the place. The customer service is horrible but only reason I return bc their snowballs are great
