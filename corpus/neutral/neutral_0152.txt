I've come here 100+ times, starting in 2012.
Overall, the food has had its ups and downs, but always been between 4-5 stars.

I have two issues that people need to be aware of... things that could really upset customers. And, unfortunately we know friends that will not go back. Frankly, we are at about our end too.

1) They ask you if you would like a spice level 1-5, 5 being Thai Spice. However, sometimes a 4 will be a 1, and a 2 will be so hot the person who ordered it can't eat it.

Today, I asked for a 3 so my wife could eat some of mine. It was prepared hotter than they have ever made it. I enjoyed it, but my wife was upset.

2) For take out, they add a 15% service fee to receipts over $20. While that is a new stated policy, they have also added it to under $20 takeout, and it's a policy that no other place near us uses.

I will not pay 15% service fee, 9.25% tax, and 20% tip. I think that is way beyond prudent expectations.

So, while we do still eat here. We have become vary wary and reduced our patronage to once every few months (as opposed to once a week)

I do hope they turn their business around. (And I will adjust my review accordingly)
