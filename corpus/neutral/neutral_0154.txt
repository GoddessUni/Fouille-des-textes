If you're looking for a place to take out of towners, or something trendy and different I'd recommend Distrito.  Part of what you're paying for however, is the unique and exciting decor.  Scorpions in the bar, a wall of lucha libre masks, and hanging seats are just a few of the things that set their decor apart from others.

The food however, is slightly expensive for the sizes.  Maybe it was my own fault for not knowing ahead of time its technically "tapas".  One enchilada for $12 was a bit steep for me.  

Overall the food has fantastic flavor, and the decor and layout is really fun...just be prepared to pay a bit if you're really hungry.

* I'd highly recommend the Ceviche de Camarones and the Esquites.
