I love what they have done to this place! Friday was our first time being here since they opened and we had a great experience! The staff and bartender (Meghan) was very nice, and quick on drinks, taking orders. I had the burger which was very good, cooked perfectly. I can only imagine how much fun this place will be on a winter night with the snow falling.

----Edit----

After returning my second time I had to change my review from 5 to 3 stars. My dad ordered 6 raw clams, of which 3 were rotten. No happy hour (but menu says there is)
