Came to frog vapor as it is very close to where we just moved. We purchased an upgraded battery and tank set up which are of pretty good quality and so far holds a charge really well which is just what we wanted. Also bought 2 bottles of juice that were mixed for us for a specific flavor we were looking for which was great. Their prices are very comparable to what we have paid everywhere else so no complaints there. We spent a good 45 minutes with Carlo (I hope that was his name... The counter rep) and he was very upbeat, knowledgable and super courteous.
Now for the negative two stars... I would have given them 5 stars HOWEVER... We were there on a Sunday around 11am and while we were being waited on there was a (very) young couple, friends of the employee, were just hanging out at the counter stools blocking the testers and using them for their personal gadgets where I actually had to reach around them while they were making out to grab a flavor. Then the boy proceeded to blow heavy vape smoke directly at our faces to the point of my eyes started to get irritated. When they weren't blowing smoke and staring they were feeling each other up and kissing. Now I'm not a prude but to have what looked like teenagers making out 4 inches away from me it was pretty uncomfortable... It's not a bar or a nightclub. Carlo should have asked his friends to step away from the counters where people were being waited on out of the way and he should have managed their Public behavior while customers are in the store. Others had walked in while we were there as well. I'm a small business owner myself and I would never allow a sale to be lost because a friend of mine was a vaped up horny teen. The employees may need a bit of a retrain as to what is appropriate business behavior in a retail setting so they don't go broke without return customers. I will go back and give it another chance.. I'm hoping the friends will have found a hotel room by then!!
