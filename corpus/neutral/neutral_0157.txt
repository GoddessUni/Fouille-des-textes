So my rating of 3 stars is simply based on the over-all decor, ambiance and snazzyness of the place. The moment I walked in and was asked if I wanted to check in my coat I knew this was no ordinary indian restaurant. A look around confirmed my suspicions. So this looked like a real upscale restaurant where everyone was all dressed up nicely and the place was decorated pretty modern. As soon as we sat down they gave us an Ipad to order drinks which blew my friend's mind cuz among our group she was the only one who does not have an iphone. Anyways they also offer complimentary sparkling water which I dont really care for.
THE FOOD:
It was ok nothing special, especially for the price you pay for it. Most portions were tiny, I guess they went for a tapas kinda feel where you order shit load of stuff and share itsy bitsy pieces with everyone. So taste wise again nothing extraordinary: basically not that great. Overall I felt kinda cheated by the amount and taste of the food we ate for the price we paid.

WORST PART: 
They only have 2 vegetarian entrees.
Baingan ka bhurta which is an egg plant thingy which is not that tasteful and
Daal Makhni: HOLD UP wth daal makhni as anyone with an indian origin will tell you IS NOT AN ENTREE. Its considered as a sauce which is typically ordered with rice as a side dish. Its basically a form of soupy lentils which people pour on top of rice, mix it and then eat it. Hence the 1 vegetarian person in our party couldn't order any DECENT VEGETARIAN entree.
