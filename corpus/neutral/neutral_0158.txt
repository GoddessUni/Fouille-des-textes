I was in the area and decided to try this place. I had the hummus bowl with the grilled steak. I also had the Sumac onions, Naf Pickles, Purple Cabbage and Chopped Salad with the Garlic sauce. I really enjoy the hummus bowl!! It was good! Good thing I tried the Baba Ghanoush before I got it. I thought it was kind of bitter here and normally I love it at other places. I also had Baklava!! It was cheaply priced at about 1.79 for a decent piece! It was good enough for that price! I wouldn't mind going here but there is a lot of places I like better.
