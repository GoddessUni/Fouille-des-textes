So I decided to stop in Warm Daddys over the weekend for a friends birthday and I was not impressed!!! I starved all week just so I can treat myself to all the things I really didn't need. First I think it's kinda crazy that they don't offer free refills on at Least one of their drinks besides water; but on a positive note they are half off on the refills and they are banging!! I ordered the skillet Mac & Cheese as my appetizer and it wasn't nothing like the last time I had it. The last time I had the Mac & Cheese it was sooo gooey and cheese made me want to dig up my ancestors and smack them. The Mac & Cheese I had over this weekend had me wanting to dig my ancestors up and beg them to help em out. Now that my appetizer is out of the way in enters my entree. Listen I used to think so highly of their fried chicken, they were in my top 5!!!! I ordered the mixed 4 piece which I never get I always get the white meat. Sidebar: the lady next to our table had the 4 piece white chicken and i was just looking at her big succulent chicken in envy . When they brought that 4 piece mixed chicken out I was like where is the chicken ?!?!? The pieces were definitely smaller than my neighbor who had all white pieces. So as I'm sitting there I'm like the skin doesn't even look the same or taste the same and then it dawned it. I'm like Yoo is this the 4 piece pre packaged mixed chicken pieces you get from Kennedy fried or something ‚Äç. Overall I was just so disappointed. But the vibe and experience is nice tho
