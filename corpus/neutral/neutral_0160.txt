Mixed feelings about this place. Gorgeous and immaculate inside and the food was great! BUT, the service was odd. When I first came in, I had to ask them about their outdoor seating, because it was not set up. They brought chairs. When I was ordering, I sensed some obvious tension between the staff regarding their break times. Also, they didn't have some of their menu options available. A little disappointing. When they brought me what I'd ordered, they didn't think to include a spoon with my yogurt, so I had to leave my dogs once again in order to go inside just for a spoon. I get that this is not a full service restaurant, but there were at least 3 servers hanging out in the place, which was not in the least bit seeming busy, and they seemed to be fighting over whose break it was the whole time; you'd think they could make the customer feel happy. They took their breaks at tables right next to the ordering area, which seems a little unprofessional. Overall, I'd eat there again, but I don't expect much out of their service.
