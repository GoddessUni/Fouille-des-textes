I am a little surprised by the negative reviews especially since this place is always PACKED in the Summer.  I really like La Jolla the food is good and the patio is great.  I would love to say that the service is wonderful but it does fit with the casual nature of the restaurant.  The servers seem as if they are friends with a lot of the customers.  This may result in them spending a bit too much time chatting but hey your time for chatting will come :-) 

I have been in Indy for almost 2 years and I have made sitting on the patio during the Summer for lunch my thing to do.
