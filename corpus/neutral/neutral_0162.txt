If you're ever on 38th between Walnut and Spruce, you can't miss this van painted in hues of pink, yellow, and green. Unknowingly from the outside, a whole bonafide Middle Eastern kitchen is housed within this sixties-esque food truck.

Hanan's an allright place for a snack, but not so great for a meal. Their falafel sandwiches with feta, hummus, baba ghanoush, etc. are always made fresh, but never truly fill you up, unless you get two. Chicken sandwiches are also pretty good here. The platters are also made on the spot, but I always feel that they mainly consist of rice & veggies while lacking in kebab. But, perhaps, I'm simply a glutton used to the giant portions of our modern-day restaurants.

A good place though for vegetarian eaters because they have a very wide range of options. It's inexpensive and orders are almost always filled within 10 minutes of ordering.
