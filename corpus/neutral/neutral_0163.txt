Another Sunday for me and the wife to head into town to nosh around the city.
First stop is a new sandwich shop that one of us stumbled apon not sure
how but we made it here. 

Since we are eating at a few places we split the steak.
It was served very quick and lip burning hot, my fault I should have known 
molten liquid cheese will do that, but I am hungry and with that comes impatience.

The meat was tender and very flavorful and we really like the cheese sauce but the 
meat was ladled on the light side and I really do not recall and onions now that 
im writing this. Glad to have tried a different steak from my fleet of top picks, but
sadly this is a one time only for us.
