My friend and I chose Elena Wu to have a nice New Year dinner and a movie.  One of the reasons this restaurant was chosen was because they did not have a special menu that we had to order.  

They called me in the morning to reconfirm my reservation and never mentioned a special menu.  Nor was it on the web site stating they had a special menu that one had to order from.

My friend arrived earlier than me and was seated when I got there.  I was sitting down and she proceeded to tell me of an incident with the owner.  

My friend relayed to me that she sat down and the regular menu was on the table.  She told me that a table of four people attempted to order off the regular menu and the owner was replacing the original menu with a New Year Prefix menu.  The table of four objected stating they wanted items off the regular menu.  They said they were vegetarians and did not want to order a huge meal from the set menu.  They got up and started to leave when the owner stopped them at the door and told them they could order off the regular menu.  Then, she attempted to do the same thing to m friend.  My friend said all she wanted was sushi.  The owner said they were too busy to make all types of food. My friend had a discussion with her and told her it was bad business.  She relented and gave us the regular menu.

The food is good but, nothing outstanding.  The sushi is delicious.  However, I have had sushi as good at ShopRite.  The regular Chinese is as good as any other Chinese restaurant and nothing to warrant a special visit.  

In lieu of what happened, I personally see no reason to return to this establishment.
