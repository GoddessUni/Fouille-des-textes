I've been here twice before, and it was decent. Pretty good food, alright deals. Good enough that I suggested to my friend that we go there to eat and have a drink when we were at a loss of where to go and needed to get out of the rain.

We ordered bloody Mary's. I knew coming in that a bloody wasn't their specialty, but that is what we were craving and we couldn't think of anywhere else to get one. It was gross. I'm not blaming the bartender, I don't know what it was, but it was just unpleasant. I could make a better one with my eyes closed.

We tried to send it back, after we both took 2 sips at most, but she refused. "It would be on our tab anyways." I understand, but ick.

Order the beers, if you drink here. Even though they don't put the prices on the menu. (I always feel like a cheep ass when i ask how much drinks cost. I understand specialty drinks, but beers?)

Rude restaurant etiquette, I think, but that's just me.

But, I have to admit, even how annoyed I was, that the few times I have eaten here I haven't been grossed out, and there was enough left over to take home.
