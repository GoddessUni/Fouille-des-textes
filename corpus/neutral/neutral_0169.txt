I realized after ordering the all-you-can-eat sushi that I really can't eat very much.  Particularly the rice, which is quite lush and tasty.  Apparently the toilets don't want any rice so I'm ashamed to say I slipped it to my friend's boyfriend as discreetly as possibly down the table.  From all of the warnings and disclaimers about the rules of eating all you can, I expected a small, Japanese waitress to throttle me as I passed off my lumps of uneaten rice, but they didn't seem to notice.

It turned out all I really wanted to eat was sashimi with a small bowl of rice so that's what I'm getting next time.
