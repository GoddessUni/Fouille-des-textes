We were regulars at Tony's in Mayfair, we recently moved to the burbs so decided to give Tony's in Ivyland a try. I will say, this restaurant is MUCH nicer. The dining room is spacious with plenty of seating, and the outdoor area and bar are great. But the food...not as good...at all. The tomato pie was like cardboard with barely any sauce, mussels in red tasted like they were still in salt water, and it came with 2 measly slices of bread. Really? 2 slices? Mayfair gives a loaf. Moving on...the fries were super well done, almost burnt. And the cheese sauce was hard as soon as it got to the table. The waitress was great, which is a plus from Mayfair, but I'll deal with crappy waitresses for better food any day. Back to the old neighborhood we go.
