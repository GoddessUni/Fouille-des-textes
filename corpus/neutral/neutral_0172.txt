We waited 20 minutes for our table. The food was great. It was my first time eating Cochon and I'd definitely try it again! The deviled eggs with bacon were good but they had a weird tang that I'm not used to in my deviled eggs. I like the simple menu and fresh ingredients. However, it doesn't seem like the kind of restaurant for paper table cloths. Also, the host made an inappropriate racial comment. I don't think he realized the impact of his comment and I'm not sure he was being malicious but it was definitely inappropriate. That is probably the reason I wouldn't come back. 

My coworker enjoyed her fried green tomatoes but not her remoulade sauce. Also, her Mac and cheese was made with spaghetti pasta. Though she said it tasted good, the texture was off with the spaghetti noodles. 

Our waiter, Brent, called us a cab at the end of the night and even offered us his uber code for a free ride (don't have uber so couldn't use it). That was nice of him.
