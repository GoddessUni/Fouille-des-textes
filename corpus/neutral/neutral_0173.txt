I was so excited to try out Seoul Garden Korean BBQ in STL for the first time. After living in Seoul for a few years, I definitely have a soft spot for Kbbq! Perhaps I'd been spoiled, because this place was quite the let down.. Unfortunately the service was average at best, and while the sides were plentiful, even the kimchi lacked flavor and freshness. I was looking forward to grilling the meat at our table, and after ordering one order of beef (about $35) the server did not let us know that it would be cooked for us in the kitchen. After it was brought out to the table we were told that if we wanted to cook it by ourselves (the actual korean bbq experience) we would have to do the all you can eat option. In favor of Seoul Garden, we all thought the beef was very tasty! 
I think people go to Korean barbecue restaurants for the delicious food and sides, but mostly for the authentic experience of cooking the meat at your own table... my particular experience at Seoul Garden was a let down. Next time I'll be trying Wudon, which I've heard better things about.
