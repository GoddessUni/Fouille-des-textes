Service is slower then other taco shacks I've been to and the menu was half blocked by taped up paper with no prices.... Parking isn't great and the salsa bar wasn't full. The tables were all dirty and the highchair was sticky and broken allowing my 11month old the opportunity  to try and stand every time I took my hand off of her. 

My lunch was yummy but overpriced for the amount I got.  Lunch for two people shouldn't go over $20 with out any drinks at this type of place. I can get much better food in Santa Paula or Oxnard for 1/2 the price. 



Side note. 
$1.95 for tacos is Crazy when Lillie's has much better Tacos for $1.60..... I however will be back during the $1 taco specials. 

The food alone is more of a 4.5 star rating but the above issues lowered my rating.
