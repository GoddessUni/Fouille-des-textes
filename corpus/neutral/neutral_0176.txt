I must say, the portions were perfect and my friend and I were totally happy ordering 2 apps and 1 entree between the both of us. I wasn't really moved by the food or the price but that could be because this place doesn't exactly cater to vegetarians and we don't have too much to chose from. 

The vegetarian dishes we ordered were the edamame dumplings and the pad thai. Dumplings were dry because they didn't use the non-veg broth and was just kinda there with no taste. And not gonna lie, but the pad thai tasted kinda like papaya salad with some crushed, red pepper sprinkled on top. My friend ordered the crab tacos as recommended by our waitress and they came out looking cute (like mini tacos) but after her first bite her remorse set it and shared that it was bland and wish she had ordered something else.

For desert, we shared the sesame donuts and indulged in our gluttony and ordered the chocolate mousse spring rolls with a side of marshmallow vanilla ice cream. The sesame donuts would have been amazing had they not gotten cold in .624 seconds, we loooved the spring rolls and the ice cream was not laced with marshmallows or anything - it tasted like plain vanilla.

I most probably won't be back but it was good for a pan asian selection of foods.
