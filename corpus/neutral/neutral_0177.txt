Pie-Face started as a very promising new establishment. They made unique, gourmet pizzas that outdid pretty much every pizza in town. The toppings were fantastic - the meats are purchased from local butchers - and the sauce and crust were solid. Recently they've started doing wings and are apparently the best in town, though I've not had the chance to try them yet.

Unfortunately, Pie-Face has spiralled down ever since. Their clientele is often annoying adolescents or "young adults" who are loud and a variety of other adjectives. The staff is mostly comprised of douchebags and jerks who will complain about you using a credit card for small orders, but if you pay with cash you are liable to have them assume its a tip and immediately toss it in the jar. You can't win.

Their slices are nice and big and a fair price, but they tend to overbake them so I highly recommend getting a full pie for a nice, soft crust.

I also take issue with them removing glorious Kronenbourg 1664 from their tap and replacing it with that lousy excuse for a pilsner. Pie-Face's specially brewed "Pie-Face Pilsner" is average at best and is certainly not worth $5 for a pint. 

They have had some other solid selections on tap, though. Namely, Rogue's Hazelnut Brown Nectar and Weihenstephaner's world-renowed Hef, which is still available but at a steep $6 per glass. Lots of neat bottle options as well, but I find it to be a tad on the pricy side.

Other things I take issue with:
-No free refills on soda
-Pepsi products
-You have to order ranch at the time of placing your order and it costs $.25. I don't like ranch, but this bothers me.
-etc. 

Pie-Face still offers a great late-night option for those of us stumbling around Reno (which according to recent statistics is pretty much the whole city). And I wouldn't hesitate to order a pie for takeout. However, I will avoid dining in due to the poor service and atmosphere.
