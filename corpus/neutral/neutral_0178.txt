Friendsgiving lunch date at Nolas.  The service was friendly, but not as exceptional or as attentive as other Emeril's affiliated locations.  The lunch menu looked inventive, but our meals fell short.  What really was outstanding were the desserts.  The caramelized apple creme brulee is out of this world!  We also gave high marks to the coconut semi-freddo.  I had the plank roasted gulf fish that came with simple olive oil drizzled tomatoes.  The fish was not firm, kinda mushy like they use frozen filets and not fresh.  The BBQ shrimp was also not a good version in a city with so many great versions.  Tried the chicken skin nachos and was disappointed that the breading on the chicken skin was so thick and actually tough to eat, not an easy appetizer to nibble on.   Definitely skip entrees and enjoy the desserts!
