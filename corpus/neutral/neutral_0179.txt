Overall experience was just OK. As many people have said, cash only. I rarely carry cash and I know I'm not the only one. I found this to be a bit of a inconvenience. I tend to raise my expectations when I encounter a cash only restaurant. 

The restaurant itself is small and very hectic inside. A shrine to all things Philadelphia. I found the ordering to be confusing and chaotic. It wasn't a packed house, just steady. There was no flow to the process. It was order (very quickly!), step to the side, and wait. You don't pay until you get your food/after you're finished eating. This is an inefficient order process for a small sandwich shop and lead to confusion. I heard a few other patrons making similar comments. 

The philly cheesesteak was just okay. I liked it, but it didn't knock my socks off either. The fries weren't seasoned at all. 

It is a really great value. My boyfriend and I split a cheesesteak and fries for dinner and that was plenty for us. Dinner was under $10. Can't beat that!
