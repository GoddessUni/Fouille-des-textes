The service was terrible at the bar, I waited forever for a drink but it seemed like the bartender was only serving guys. I had my Fiance go to buy us drinks and he had them within 10 minutes. 

I can forgive this as it is a single server and maybe she was just hating. Then their drinks came out and our tiny plastic cups were $7 each. Not worth it at all. 

The show they had, Frequency on Friday night was awesome and I will certainly be back to check it out next time. Great music, good vibe in the crowd. Ill try tequilas food next round too and let you all know if it was good!
