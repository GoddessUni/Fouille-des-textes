I went here before a show at Ruth Eckerd Hall because I was running short on time. Not a bad choice when you're in a hurry. But not somewhere I'd goto for dinner without time constraint. Gyro meat was very good. And the price is good too. You can get basic beer and wine too. However, you order at the front and they bring your meal to you. I guess that qualifies as "Fast Casual". And the decor and ambiance... I feel like the place should be crawling with people north of 80 years old. Come on now... modern up a bit! Probably a good destination for lunch. And I think the food quality is better than Little Greek.
