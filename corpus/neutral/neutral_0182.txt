Cancun is one of those places I find myself at fairly often, although there's not one single thing I can say draws me back there....other than it's convenient.

The food is good.  Best Mexican in Indy/Carmel?  No, probably not.  The service is good....actually the service there is well above what I've come to expect from restaurants in the Indy area.

The price is reasonable, and, as one reviewer noted, you do get a LOT of food for the money.

It's not an over the top outstanding experience, but it IS good food and good service for a reasonable price, and for that reason, I'm a regular. :)
