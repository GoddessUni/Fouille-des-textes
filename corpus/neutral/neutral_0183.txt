After getting multiple recommendations from friends and colleagues, I tried this place. Customer service deserves 4.stars. I was seated quickly and the staff was great. They were awesome and attentive.The food was blah. I had BBQ shrimp and grits. My food was lukewarm and under seasoned. A couple of shrimp still had the shell on them and  grits were very watery with no salt or anything. I'm not a fan of the sugar cane butter. The biscuit tasted like salty dough. The coffee was ok I guess. A huge let down for a $20 breakfast. The long wait lines are not worth it. I guess I should stay away from tourist traps.
