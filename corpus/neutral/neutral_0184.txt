Right before you hit the causeway for the beach is a nice little kitschy diner where you find pretty decent brunch food. I visited it this past Sunday with my boyfriend. We can tell it's definitely a popular local spot as there were quite a few parties waiting to be seated. We waited inside for about 15 minutes or so and were seated in one of the dining rooms. I loved the decor and how tacky it was and how it really involves the tourists that probably were on their way to Indian Rocks Beach that day.

I ordered the breakfast burrito while my boyfriend got the bacon avocado benedict. My burrito was pretty good. It was stuffed with eggs, potatoes, bacon, sausage and cheese. It came with a side of sour cream and salsa. It was pretty big and I could only finish about 75% of it. It was pretty good.

My boyfriend's meal looked kinda of small. He got his benedict with a side of grits. Looked pretty basic to me.

All in all, it was a good dining experience and food was okay. Pretty simple. I'll probably would be back but only because it's conveniently located by the beach so I may stop in again before a beach trip.
