I was hungry & i was excited to try the new Natural burger. The server i had was Carmen. I asked how big the patty was because i couldn't decide whether to get Single or Double, & she responded w/ "it's the size of a penis."
I was so surprised of what she said that i responded w/ "that's fine." 

Then when i pulled up to the window, she took about 5 minutes to get the food. Nobody else seemed to be around: no customers except me, & i didn't see any other employees from the outside.

Both of those things were unprofessional.

I took my order at 11:19pm about 40 minutes ago.

The meat of the All Natural Burger tastes dry. And the burger itself costs $8? Sheesh.
