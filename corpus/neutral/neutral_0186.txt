To start with, the Ridiculous Bloody Mary:  the dressings of the huge stuffed and deep fried mushroom and wing?  Those were amazing!  The drink itself?  Eh, tasted like tomato juice and vodka.  Pretty disappointing.  We ordered a variety of food and shared everything.  We ordered the sampler chip appetizer and none of the 4 of us were blown away by any of the 3 dips.  Not bad, just not great.  I ordered the Lettuce Wraps and all of us LOVED them!  Also, hubby ordered the Shrimp Street Tacos and all of us really enjoyed them too.  So, it was kind of a split food and drink-wise.  It seems like a fun place, and I like that you can play bags indoors, especially as hot as it's been lately!  Not an inexpensive place though.  I'd go back.  I sure hope they step up their Bloody Mary game though!  I mean, they ARE a bar!!!
