Not quite ready for prime time. A number of the staff have been held over from the Lit Moose. Sat in bar area at a booth. Very comfy. 

Wine list limited but tasty selections for a place like this. Beer selection is quite good and varied. Kudos. 

Food was not great. They were crushed with business around 6:30 on a Saturday and mistakes were made. "Barbeque" chicken pizza with just red sauce. Chicken stir fry made Asian by drowning in soy sauce and featured very dry chicken. Not good. 

We'll try again but they might want to slim their menu down 

Cheers
