Love the ambience..very friendly waitress..10% off checked in from yelp is awesome..we actually wanted togo to han dynasty..but they are full and since we were 8 peoples include kids its just too crowded and they said we have to reserve couples day earlier..wow

But think to bring kids to spice 28 on Saturday nights for dinner is inappropriate since the bar is full to...

 Ok dan dan noodles very yummy hehe..stir fry string bean is good BUT the SPICY THING chicken,shrimp and beef that we had is so salty...its really good flavor iits just toooooo salty...I felt like eating salt in my mouth so do all my friend's told me..so its not me problem...
