Don't particularly enjoy this food court, because it is stuffy with kitchen heat, and not special. But I keep coming back because of its central location. It is quicker and cheaper than the other nearby upenn facilities. I liked quiznos brand at one point and this one could bring me back into the fold. Everyone notices how extremely nice and conscientious the employees are. And they make a darn good sandwich. I don't want for much else. I would give 4 stars if only the cookies and chips/ combos didn't cost well over a buck but at these prices I had to take a pass on dessert. They are asking too much for ordinary items which are elsewhere for considerably less. I understand this is more a fault of the chain than this particular proprietor.
