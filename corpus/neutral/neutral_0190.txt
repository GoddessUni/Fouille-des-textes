This review is not for the food, although we walked by it one day between Christmas and  New Years, during lunch time and tourist season, and there was literally NO ONE in the restaurant. My review, however is of the platinum blonde waitress, who quite possibly could be the poster girl for dumb blondes. The reason we were walking up and down the Ybor strip was because we were on a mission to find the best Cuban sandwich in Ybor. So when we stuck our heads in here, and she approached us, I asked her if she knew where to get a great Cuban sandwich. Her reply, "Unfortunately we don't really have any Cuban restaurants in this area."  WHAT !!!!!!!!!  Asides from Miami, this is the most Cuban neighborhood in the UNITES STATES, lol.
