I love me some Greek Salads and Spinach Pie (Spanikopita).  I drive in this area quite often and noticed that this place had a new name from what it used to be.  The name says it all and was enough for me to give it a try.  I came here on a Saturday afternoon.  There was nobody else here at the time.  

I placed a to-go order of a large greek salad minus the beets and olives (just not my thing) as well as an order of Spinach Pie (which indicated on the menu that it was homemade).  Friendly staff.  The order itself took only about 5 minutes.

Food was really good.  Spinach Pie is one of my favorite greek dishes and this was made perfectly.  Greek Salad was also good.  I would definitely come back here.
