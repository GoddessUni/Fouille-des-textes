We stopped in to try Roberto's today.
 I would probably give them 3 1/2 stars rather than three stars.
I enjoyed their rolled tacos with guacamole and cheddar cheese they were tasty. I had read so many good things about these rolled tacos so I thought I would try them. They were good different don't know that I would try them again I do feel that Jimboys tacos are better to my liking.
My husband enjoyed the chili relleno and a chicken taco.
We arrived early at 11:00 AM to beat the rush. We were able to get a seat in the restaurant it's very colorful in the restaurant and clean.
I think their location is very good for downtown and the University of Nevada.
The parking is not very good at all only have spots for 3 to 5 cars.
Their prices are average our lunch cost $11.20 and we didn't really have that much.
There are so many Mexican restaurants in Reno and Sparks I don't know that I would return to this restaurant.
