I give Koto 3/5 stars only because I'm a Sushi snob and I definitely believe Sushi should be taken extremely seriously. Nevertheless, I love Koto for several reasons:
1- Decent menu with a variety of decent rolls and other basic Japanese dishes.
2- Proper lunch and dinner sets menu
3- Located right in downtown.
4- Good service and genuine staff

I'd say some of their rolls can be slightly overpriced. The tuna is definitely not as fresh as they should be. The miso soup is just a Westernized version of miso. There is a lack of Sashimi counterparts in the menu. 

However since they are super close to where I live and work, I just can't think of any better place to get some take out whenever I crave Sushi, which happen pretty often!
