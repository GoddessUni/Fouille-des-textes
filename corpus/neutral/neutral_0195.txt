I haven't really been satisfied with the state of Jamaican food in the area since the pink truck closed down. There is a place I enjoy in Sicklerville, but that is a hike. It is a blessing to discover an establishment located no more than 15 minutes from my home. I purchased a $30 Groupon that afforded us one appetizer, 2 drinks, and two entrees, pretty much a sign that there was no better time to see what this place was about. After reading the reviews the choice was easy. 

We started our dining service sharing a chicken patty as an appetizer. We agreed that we should have ordered something else. For starters the patty wasn't warm enough but most importantly it lacked flavor. The crust and the filling were bland. 

In regards to our entrees, I decided to order a dish that I haven't had in such a long time; oxtails. The wife got her standard jerk chicken. Each entrée was served with a heaping portion of peas & rice, cabbage, and plantain. The oxtails were not bad but, I would probably go with a different entrée next time. The jerk chicken was good. It was cooked and seasoned just right. The wife doesn't like spicy food so the mild dish was good for her. I would probably order the jerk chicken during next visit but instead of the mild version, request the spicy chicken instead. 

Give a take a few things; I can say with absolute that we both were pretty satisfied with our meal and overall dining experience. The restaurant is nice and the service is good. Little Negril seems like a decent place and I will certainly dine there again. Some reviews mention the music. I want to hear a little more Freddie McGregor, Dennis Brown, or Jah Cure next time I dine there.
