Simple and fresh. This is what I think about the food @Cafe Patachou. The menu is pretty simple: soups, salads, sandwiches or omelets - with different variations. They also serve breakfast variety and desserts. The ingredients are fresh, most menu comes with bowl of a fresh fruits and toasts. The food tastes so delicious. The place is normally packed on lunch hour during weekdays or brunch hour in the weekends, but the food usually arrives at reasonable time. I love their omelets. Their cinnamon toast is to die for....yum... 

Overall, the food is good. My only complaints: high price tag. $6 for kids meal (with fruits and no drink included, except water). $8 minimum for omelets and up. $9 for a big bowl of salad. It will cost you $14 per adult for lunch (including tip, and no drink other than free ice water). Also $2.95 coffee (with free refills) is still pretty high, especially when you have to get the coffee by yourself. I just wish the price could go lower a little bit, I could have gone there more often - having brunch with friends and family.
