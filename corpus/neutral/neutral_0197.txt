Day 2 of our adventure into St. Charles and we needed a patio to sit on. Well, I did. Jacki was a little reluctant, but after seeing the fire pits on Saturday she decided it was nice enough to be outside. Again no wait. I'm excited to see what it looks like down here on a really nice day. I'm also interested to know how many they can sit out on this patio.

We didn't try any of the wine. Potential mistake, after hearing that we could have had three free samples at the bar, but were okay. After seeing the table next to us with the loaded waffle fries, we had to have them. There was a little arguing about what we were going to order and trying to stay in the health theme, but when Jacki rushed me to order on his third trip back to the table I went with the fries. They were delicious. That cheese sauce, must be the work of magic. Awesome amount of decent sized pieces of bacon. Tomatoes, scallions (I think), sour cream on the side. So good! I also ordered chili with which the fries went great. Jacki got a house salad with a roasted tomato dressing (? or something like that). She originally said it tasted like ketchup, but I think she was just mad at me. It was really good. The chili didn't quite have the heat of Trailhead's, Jacki described it as being a little sweet, and the chunks of beef were bigger and varied. I think the beans were better in this one. 

Server was a little awkward, but friendly and efficient. I would like to come back here for the patio and possibly try some wines. We'll see.
