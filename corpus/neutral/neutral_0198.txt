Food was good. The service was good. The chairs is very uncomfortable. It seems to be geared to smaller people I am a good sized person. The curvature of the back of the chair just doesn't feel proper. I didn't want to stay very long. After the gentleman served us, he left to talk to others. We wanted dessert but he was still talking. Finally as I was getting even more uncomfortable in the little metal chair, a lady saw us. Came over and finished taking our order. She was so polite and nice. We got our flan, then paid and left. Oh and the gentleman still talking to the only other 2 customers in the place. The chef did come out I told him he did a really great job cooking. Well if you go I hope yall don't get the chatty gentleman.
