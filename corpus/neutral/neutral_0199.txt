Went here with a friend on a weeknight when it was dead. They get 3 stars because the service was great and the lady was very friendly. The atosphere was ok, kind of typical. nothing about hte place really wow'ed me as far as the decor went. Though I did like reading the small blurbs on the placemat about chinese astrology.

Now the food, well it was just so-so. I didn't find it to be anything special. The food was a tad on the overly salty side. I ended up getting sick after eating here but I don't know if it was the food itself or something I was alergic too. Still, not worth it for sure. I did like the almond cookie at the end though. That was tasty.
