The pastries I've tried from La Patisserie Chouquette were flawless.  Absolutely delicious and totally authentic. The retail space is adorable and the staff was friendly, too.

The prices, however, are ridiculous.  Four dollars for one stuffed croissant?  I get it, it's hand made, locally sourced, exceptionally high quality, you get what you pay for, etc., but Whole Foods charges 89 cents for one plain croissant.  When your prices are four to five times that of Whole Foods, you might want to reconsider what you're charging.

Perhaps their pricing is a blessing in disguise.  If their pastries were reasonably priced, I'd be in their shop all the time stuffing my face!
