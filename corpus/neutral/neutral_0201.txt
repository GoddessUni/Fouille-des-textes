Great friendly gastro-pub.

With all the great beer bars in Philly, I wouldn't necessarily make the trip here to drink.  It's a ways off the beaten path and an $11 cab fare from Old City.  I will, however, give them major props for their website, which provides some great directions.

I would make the trip here for their food.  The crawfish doughnuts are great.  The spare rib pasties are really well done.  And the pork rillettes (kind of like carnitas) with brussels sprouts are a top notch bar snack.

They have a great menu with some creative options at good prices.  Also cater to gluten-free diners.

I'll be back for the fried chicken!
