We ate there this past Saturday night (11/24/12).  I have always wanted to eat in that old building in Phoenixville.  It was a nice atmosphere for dinner.  The menu selection was great.  I could have easily chosen 4 or 5 things on the menu, maybe more.  The drink selection was even decent.  But the negative was that the drinks were a bit pricy for my liking.  Although they did add enough vodka to my drink to make it somewhat worth it.  I thought the portions were great and time between appetizers and entrees were nicely paced. I didn't feel rushed at all.  For 2 adults and one child we felt it was a bit pricey.  But we would try it again, just not anytime too soon.
