Great Food  BAD SERVICE! 

Their sushi is excellent 

Their oysters on a half shell Are excellent and BIG! 

The Oysters Rockefeller took too long to prepare and had to be returned twice once  due to the fact ingredients were missing, then I was given what I assume was reheated microwave oysters, I kept asking for bread 3X and never received, I asked for a dirty Martini and it was served in a wine glass, apparently they ran out of martini glasses and it was not properly made. I asked to speak with a manager I was told the person was on the phone. When I was leaving the manager approached me and I explained, I spent enough time with chaos and did not have additional time to chat about the lack of service.  

I been back for their sushi and the service is spotty and forgetful.
