I came here for dinner after ordering a burger to- go months beforehand that I really enjoyed. I figured dinner would meet my expectations considering I enjoyed my burger and the reviews for this place are exceptional. My girlfriend and I proceeded to have one of the most underwhelming meals I've had in Tampa. 

Our server was very friendly but failed to check in on us or our food when it was obvious we should have received our meals after a prolonged wait of nearly 45min (would normally be understandable if the place was busy, but we were one of a few tables present). We did however get the lobster bisque appetizer, which I can honestly say was a HARD miss. Instead of a traditional/standard offering, they added pickles, green olives, and pieces of buttered sourdough toast. The result? It was pretty not great. If you've ever wanted to know how to absolutely butcher a crowd favorite dish like lobster bisque, just add pickles and green olives.

For the main entrees, I had the grilled octopus and my girlfriend had the scallops. The octopus was just ok but the scallops were definitely the highlight. The price was exorbitant for the experience we had, which is a huge factor here for me. There are few things I hate more than going out for food, spending a lot of money on that food, and being left incredibly disappointed.

Hopefully this was a one-off experience, but given that Tampa has so many options at a much better price point, I most likely would not return.
