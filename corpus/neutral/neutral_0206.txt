I got two po boys...grilled shrimp and grilled salmon. 

I give them 5 stars for food since it was very good!!! 

I ordered online on a Saturday at 5:13pm and my email said that it would be ready at 5:42pm. I got there around 5:35pm and went inside to see if they had peach cobbler. They didn't and I bought a slice of cheesecake instead. I told them that I had already ordered online and they told me to wait in the car until they called me. 

At 6:09 I called and asked if my food was ready. They asked me for my name and told me "yes, you can come in and get it". 

I walked up and there was a line outside. The sign on the door said "only 3 customers allowed in the store at a time". I went in anyway since I had already ordered and was picking up food. The woman, taking orders with a notepad from the 6 customers inside the store, told me to wait outside. 

Here's the problem. 

1) How long was my food sitting there? I wonder if they had any intention on calling me. 

2) Someone should be outside taking orders. 

3) The completed orders waiting on the counter should be given out before new orders should be taken. The customers who were told that their food was ready should take priority over new orders. Completed orders should never be sitting there waiting for people to pick them up especially when the person is there.
