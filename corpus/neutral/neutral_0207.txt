Isla verde has the Latin flair, with a live salsa band and DJ (Saturday nights)
The service is very good and the food is decent
I went with a friend for some food and dancing. He ordered a sampler with patacones and I had the shrimp ceviche. Both very tasty but not the best, we also had mojitos and corona. 
The vibe was very good for a Saturday night even though It wasn't too packed.
One thing I disliked is the set up of the place, the tables for eating are near the entrance and the band is facing them. However the bar area is kinda hidden to watch the band play. I wish they would redecorate the place too, since it's a bit outdated.
We danced the night away, so for dancing this place is it!!!
