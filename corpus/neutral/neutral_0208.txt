I can't avoid this place. Let's face it. If you have kids this is the restaurant that they want to go to. It's All about making your kids happy right ? 

This experience was better than the last although still not the greatest. Our waitress was good and pretty damn patient. Not gonna lie, my Son and niece destroyed our table with spills and broken crayons ... stuff happens. She handled it professionally. 

My burger was basic. I've Had better. It was good enough though....basic chicken tenders... basic fries. Basic appetizers ...You get the idea. 

Ok rating is appropriate.
