I went to Seasons 52 last night with three friends.  Since it was a Friday night, we arranged to meet there at 5pm in order to snag a table at the bar. These booths are first come, first served so if you don't want to hover around diners who beat you to a booth, get there early! The bar has a piano in the center, with live entertainment starting around 6pm on Fridays. 
Megan was our server. She was attentive, and understood we didn't want to be rushed, which worked out great, although we felt the pressure of the hoverers eyeing our booth from their barstools! 
Be prepared to fork over some cash if you order drinks and apps, desserts- our bill per person came out to about $75/pp. heres's what we tried and how we rated out of 10 point scale:
Steak,mushroom blue cheese flatbread: 10
Garlic chicken flatbread:8 (bring breath mints- whoa)
BBQ chicken full size salad: 7. Chicken was dry
duck salad: 7. Ditto on the "dry"
desserts: for $2.50 a pop, fun to try- key lime is best bang for calories and flavor, chocolate peanut butter is smooth and delicious. rocky road with marshmallow was good.   All desserts are fun to try @ $2.50, right there in front of you- everyone tried one. Smart, smart marketing. 
All in all, nice night out- three stars because dinner is much more expensive here than the $$ given by Yelpers. If you want to do try this place on the $$ level, go for lunch!
