So I made a reservation on open table.  Sorry I didn't make it before the restaurant opened but if you use open table you're supposed to keep up with it all night, short-asian-hostess-girl.  This is how you avoid the situation that happened on Friday

We waited 20 minutes for a table after our reservation.  The worst part was...we had a table cleared for us and some random yuppies from the bar decided that table was for them and sat there.  The hostess did NOT move them.  I guess their money was greener than ours so they can break the rules while we wait.  

After we eventually got a table service was quick.  Our appetizers came out very quickly (I love the Poutine) and but the entrees took a little time.  

I'm not pretentious enough to review the food any more than it was very tasty and decadent
