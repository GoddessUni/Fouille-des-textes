We went back recently and the renovation is, I will admit, really, really nice. The place is huge, stylish and there is a lot more space between the tables. This time, however, I decided to branch out and try the pho (which was pretty overpriced). We asked the waiter how it was and he indicated that it was not that great. In fact, he didn't seem terribly thrilled about any of the food there--not that encouraging. I guess at least he was honest. The food is still serviceable but nothing exciting. A little pricey for what you get. I'd go somewhere else before I go here, but it is close and the inside is gorgeous.
