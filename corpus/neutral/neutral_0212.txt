Came here for a late lunch on Saturday. We got seated right away since the place wasn't busy. Our waiter, James, was friendly and checked on us a few times throughout our meal. The hubby had the battered salmon w/onion rings, I had the turkey burger and the kids had the chicken nachos and grilled cheese sandwich. All of us agreed that the food was just ok as far as taste. My turkey burger had way too much mayo on the bun so I ended up just taking the turkey party, bacon and veggies off of it and just ate it like a salad without the bun. I tasted my hubby's salmon and it was a bit on the oily side. The onion rings were good. All in all service was good, and the food satisfied our hunger at the time. But since nothing was memorable, not sure if we will be back.
