I would give this place 'FOUR' stars for their great food and and service. Hands down one of the best southern style, dry rub, BBQ I have experienced. The place itself (interiors) is not very impressive. Our table was wobbling and the server didn't care much about it either, making it feel like it was a normal thing around.

Back to food - we tried their Brisket (Tip: mix lean and moist) and pulled pork, which was delicious. Wonder bread served along might not be the best option but was not a bad combination either and tasted good when mixed with house spicy BBQ sauces and  coleslaw. 

They have a great collection of local American bottle and can beers and on tap they have good selection from local Philly breweries, Victory being one of my favorites now. 

Hope you all enjoy this place as much as we did !! 

PS: Great Mac and Cheese !
