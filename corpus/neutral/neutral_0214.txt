It's a cute little place nestled in an alley way behind shops. We got a recommendation for this place from a native and I especially was so excited to try this place out (i love some good Italian food). 

We made a reservation for 7:30pm (definitely suggest making the reservation for Fridays and Saturdays to ensure  you get table). 
We were a little early and hung out at the hostess stand for a few minutes before being seating. This gave us the perfect chance to see the food coming out of the kitchen. and all i can say is: Oh My My! the pizzas looked amazing! 

Anyways, we were seated and then greeted by our server Caleb (very nice). We ordered waters just because we had plans to visit Broadway and didn't want to drink too much. 

I ordered the Penne Alla Vodka and my husband ordered the lasagna. To be honest, I definitely wish I ordered a pizza when i saw so many coming out to the tables. 

My husband's lasagna was tasted great. My longing for the pizza came from my small disappointment from the penne. When the pasta dish came out, the pasta was a little too hard and far from al dente. I didn't say anything because it seems as though everyone's definition of al dente is different now a days. The dish also lacked alot of sauce and was a little on the dryer side. i did find a small sauce pocket and used this to my advantage. 

I did see that the table close by did order a salad and it was big enough for two to share. The pizza is also large enough to share too. 

All in all, I would definitely go back- however, I would opt for the pizza and a salad rather than a pasta dish.
