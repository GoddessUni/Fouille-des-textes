The layout for this place is odd.  They tried to make the most room for seating, but you walk in the door and stand in a tiny walk-in area in line and don't have a whole lot of time to consider the menu.

I wasn't really impressed with my All American Cheeseburger; there was nothing outstanding about it except that the bun was too small for the burger!  The fries were okay - I asked for cheese fries and since they weren't offered on the menu, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised to get non-melted shredded cheese on top of my fries.  Not sure how I felt about that, but I guess it technically counts as cheese fries...  I chose to eat it that way instead of asking them to melt it for me.  They were so busy that customers were standing around with their food while waiting to have the tables cleared.  I would have liked this place better if it were less expensive, of if the price of the burger included fries.

I will tell you that I can't remember the last time I had a decent rootbeer float.  Barq's in a glass bottle and a chilled glass mug of vanilla ice cream.  Perfection!
