Great food, although the service was slightly MEH.

Our waitress was a sweet lady, but she came to our table maybe 4 times while we were there, walked past 3 times before remembering to grab the boxes we asked for.

It was a Sunday, so they only do the Fried Chicken dinners which come with fried chicken, green beans, biscuits, mashed potatoes & a pepper gravy, and a very interesting, but good, corn custard all served home-style.

After meals, I saw the servers clearing plates from other tables and mentioning their complementary dessert that they would bring out. Our server never came around to clear off our plates although we were all clearly done with our food in the 4 times she visited our table, but did bring us our check. Came back after she ran the card and just said thank you have a good day. Never mentioned the complementary dessert to us, but as we were walking out she went to the table next to us & said that she would start clearing plates to bring out dessert. 

I wasn't too concerned about this being left out of our experience, BUT if it is something you offer to your customers, just like...mention it to all of your customers because we never necessarily said we didn't want it. 

Still a great place!! Would recommend!
