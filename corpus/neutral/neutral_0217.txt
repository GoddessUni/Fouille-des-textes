I have been enjoying my favorite steak sandwich for many years at Coliseum Pizza & Steak.  The staff are very loyal and have been in the business for over 30 some years.  My steak is always cooked to perfection.  Large portion of fries and fresh fried mushrooms to compliment the steak are amazing. The d√©cor is really really outdated as well as the serving dishes are right out of the 70's, wooden salad bowl, oil & vinegar condiments and salt & pepper shakers are filthy. They have not changed the menu in 40 years but that's the reason the food remains constant.
