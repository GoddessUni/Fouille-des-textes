The venue is great and has a nice feel.  Didn't get to try the pastries since they were sold out but ordered the avocado toast, cauliflower rice and the salad with tuna.  The avocado toast was the best item from those three.  The cauliflower rice didn't have much flavor and was mediocre.  The salad with tuna and egg had good quality tuna but the harissa sauce and oil dressing did not compliment each other too well.  There was also something bitter in the salad (I think it could have been capers but not positive) that took away from the overall dish.  I will be back to try the pastries and probably the bagels/toast but not the salad/grain dishes.
