I've traveled to Cuba and tried the food there, and I can confidently say that Alma de Cuba is much too overpriced for the quality.

With that said, the service is great!  Great atmosphere, great servers who try to get to know you by name.

I didn't know this was a Stephen Starr restaurant, but now it makes sense, and it explains the overpriced menu.
With this sort of money, you can enjoy  other places in Philadelphia that actually serves good food.

I tried three appetizers and a full dish.  All of the food was very nicely presented and looked great! But really, if you're on a date and have to set a plate down from a bookshelf looking thing, my clumsy self was too scared to touch it.  
The food itself was okay.  Nothing horrible, and the portions were much more filling than one would think.  What I can say is that the taste was too shallow for me.  

The feel of the restaurant is very sophisticated and allows one to be brainwahsed into thinking that this restaurant is so awesome... But in reality, save your money for some good food, and take your dates here if you just want to impress them.
