Some friends who were raised in NO love Bud's so I've been to this spot a few times. I'm not won over. French fries were soggy but the onion rings were okay. I don't like a thin beef patty. What puts this a notch above McD is that you can add their special sauce or chilli to the burger. They also offer a hotdog so there is more variety on menu. A chicken sandwich too. The people are friendly. They offer crushed ice in their drinks and I am always delighted by that. The building is a throwback to earlier days and you access the bathroom from the outside. It all felt like an "experience" but nothing I would choose to do again.
