I needed to make a mirepoix but it was 6pm and the truck near Progress Plaza was closed.  I remembered there was this tiny shack that had produce in the name so I rode over to get those three essential vegetables.  Inside, it's pretty small in space and crowded, the produce is in the front, the dairy case in the middle, steamed seafood in the back in which the smell permeates the entire store.  I saw that you can get close to a pound of steamed snow crab legs, steamed small potatoes, and broccoli for $9, which seems like a sweet deal.  I didn't see any blue crabs.

I bought a bag of onions, carrots, and celery, but I didn't even meet the $5 minimum required for a credit card.  Shit, so I scrambled and picked up a quart of milk and a bag of collard greens and finally managed to eek a few cents past a Lincoln.  That's seriously cheap produce.  However, the reasons were clear to me, some of the stuff has had better days.  The celery was starting to turn pale green and the carrots seemed to be kinda dry.  This didn't ruin my mirepoix, but I certainly would not serve them fresh.

Maybe it was Monday and the produce sat over the weekend, but the damn stuff was so cheap I wouldn't really hesitate to come back if my main produce truck wasn't open.  I think I'll just get seafood for dinner next time and skip the mirepoix needs.
