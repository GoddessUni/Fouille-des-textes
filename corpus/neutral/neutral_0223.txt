A fun bar scene for happy hour.  The happy hour menu is great to pick/mix/share with a friend or two.  Oysters are great.  And the happy hour prices for the bar menu are very reasonable.  Don't look to save any money on drinks, however, as pricey as you will find in the already pricey Rittenhouse area. The regular bartenders are good with a little attitude though.  The new bartenders need some work.

I am a frequent bar customer, had dinner in the restaurant section once, where the food is average or just above, and the service is average or just below.

See ya at the bar, no reason to have a sit down.
