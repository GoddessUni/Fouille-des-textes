Finally a Korean BBQ worth having. Their selection of meats are a bit slim and lack some sauces to make it relatively authentic, but they had some really good eats like the Galbi and Spicy pork. Though quite a bit expensive, but worth a try once in a while. 

They have a few options for the all you can eat; sushi, regular buffet for $19.99, and sushi, regular buffet, and Korean BBQ for $24.99. Unfortunately they don't allow you to choose a no sushi option. The sushi is OK but definitely not worth the extra money when having it with the BBQ. 

I would recommend this place for the occasional splurge, but definitely not a regular for us unless they can figure out how to improve their pricing structure.

Also, let's hope they don't skimp on their quality after a year of operation like other Asian restaurants in the area.
