I'm giving this 3 stars and I'd probably give it 4 if the wait wasn't so incredibly long. Not that they didn't warn us, but we did wait probably close to 2 hours just to be seated and we did have a group of 6, but it felt like an awful lot of people who arrived after us got seated before us. We had to go across the street to get snacks because we were so hungry. 

Once we finally got seated, it was really loud and crazy in the back dining room, but there were some pretty drunk and crazy groups who eventually did leave. Also,  the AC was cranked on full blast, which was nice, but almost everyone in my group commented on how freezing cold it was. We got drinks quickly and then ordered some salads which came quickly too. The buttermilk ranch dressing was too die for and our waitress gave us extra for our food! 

The burger was a bit rare for my liking and was good but not amazing and the baked potato was also yummy but not the most amazing thing. 

If you're staying nearby and have time, hit it up, but I wouldn't say it's a must visit.
