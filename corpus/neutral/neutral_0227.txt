They're close to a bunch of hotels,  and appear to do a good business with locals as well.  This is the 2nd trip that I have visited them on,  and on both occasions I have found them: busy,  easy to get a seat at the large bar, less than warm and friendly,  and a bit mediocre in the food department.  I'm puzzled about what the draw is for locals, except for the fact that in seems to be a bit of a pickup spot for those early to middled aged Franklin divorced folks. It's amusing to watch the "action," pretty funny.
