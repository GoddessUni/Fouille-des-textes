My hubs and I have gotten a red and white wine flight, which is 9oz total for $25/each, so you're not getting a whole lotta sips, just enough to entice you to order a glassful. It's a way to sample different wines, good for someone like myself that hasn't developed mature taste buds, yet. 

Here's a sample of what we tried:
France: Fruity, exemplified Grenache grape strongest. 
Spain: Nice flavor.
Australia: Light, fruit forward and not heavy, ripe raspberry versus dark cherry & light bodied.

The red and white wine is different compared to what we have at home, loved that red wine was lightly chilled since I opted to be outside in the patio area. 

There was a constant breeze outdoors, so temperatures were perfect and lovely. There are vines itching to spread out on the side of the building and loved the strung up lights.

Each wine flight was nice, brought something different to the table. I'd consider coming back to try their Farmer's Platter (mix & match cheese, curled meats & bites).

I'd select 3.5/5 stars if only there was an option for that!
