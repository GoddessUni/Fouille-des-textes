I dragged my partner-in-dine to Seven Cups for an afternoon (Chinese) tea. We liked the decor of the place. There's an impressive Guanyin (Goddess of Mercy) wood statue in the foyer to greet the customers. They also have a shop selling tea leaves and tea paraphernalia. We were seated immediately. There was a sign on each table reminding everyone about "one person = one pot of tea" and "maximum stay of 2 hours." They also had piped-in Chinese music which added authenticity to the setting. We ordered the "Ba Xian" tea (Eight Immortals brand Oolong tea) for two and a piece of Lotus Moon Cake. The moon cake was delectable but quite expensive for its size. The first flush of the tea was very good. It had a soothing taste complemented by an aromatic smell. Nobody came around to refill our teapot until I flagged down one of the servers. The second steeping produced a shockingly bland taste. It was like drinking a completely different tea from the first batch. I told my brother who lives in China and is somewhat a tea connoisseur about it. He said that high-grade tea should still taste very good even after the second pouring of hot water. I agree with him. I am a regular tea drinker and have my own stash of assorted teas at home. I always steep my tea leaves in at least two pots of hot water and the taste is consistently good even after several steeping. So, I was quite disappointed with the quality of tea at Seven Cups. I might still go there in the future when the urge to envelop myself in the atmosphere of a Chinese-themed teahouse hits me again.
