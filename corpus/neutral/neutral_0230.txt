I want to like this place. I really do. I was there on opening day in 2001. It is definitely the closest supermarket to my home and I usually walk there when I go. HOWEVER, the pricing is a tad bit higher than ShopRite or ThriftWay, and they have serious freshness issues in both dairy and the bakery. Never once have I found fresh kaiser or hoagie rolls. Not once. They are hard as rocks when I get there, let alone 12 to 24 hours later at home when I can use them as a hammer. Take a look at the expire dates on the milk, it is a lot sooner than most supermarkets and thus milk only lasts about three days until it goes sour when milk everywhere else lasts five or more days. Because of these issues I've started driving to ThriftWay in PortFishington rather than walk to SuperFresh, and that is sad.
