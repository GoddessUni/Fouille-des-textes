Typical sports bar atmosphere. Some semi-rude staff, some staff that is indifferent, some staff members are cool. Don't expect to be coddled or treated with any kind of importance. This is a money mill, and you will see it when you get here. Food is edible, but not great. Parking is harsh, but given the location there's not much they can do about it. Ferg's is pretty much the spot you go to after you've grown up a little bit and finally have had enough of drinking yourself sick at Shepherd's... It's like the next step up... Then you grow up even more and figure out that you really have nothing in common with Ferg's... You stop messaging Ferg's, it gets to that weird point where you haven't called in so long that it would just be like a forced conversation so you end up sounding disingenuous and then Ferg's is like "why are you even calling me?" so you just don't call any more and you go your separate ways only to see each other again at a 10 year reunion and pretend like you were besties and ask each other "why don't we hang anymore?" but you really know that you're not going to call each other again because what the hell would you even do-it's not like Ferg's is in to paddle boarding, they just want to make that money... Which is okay, but just not your thing, you know?@ So like I was saying, it is packed, hot, miserable and Ferg's has (in general) a shallow sense of customer service. The good news is that it's a pretty good stop-off point to hang out and get drunk before/after the Rays games.    Worth a visit... Even if it's just to prove my point. Just my $.02
