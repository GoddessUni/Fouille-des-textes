Perfect for getting together with friends ... stay warm and cozy inside on a chilly night or feel the breeze outside (possibly emanating from a VERY LOUD bus) during the summer. As a 30-year-old a bit too fancy to truly appreciate Doobie's, the Pub and Kitchen definitely serves as a  favorite neighborhood bar. I must say the Blueberry Cosmo is divine, and I'm not one to ever endorse a Cosmo. However, I have to ding the Pub and Kitchen for a) removing the po' boy - a remarkably good sandwich - from the menu and b) clearly downgrading the quality of the meat in their chicken wings. Given how busy this place gets, it seems to me they could take more pride in the food.
