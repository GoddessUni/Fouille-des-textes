Very excited after reading the reviews.  Must say I was disappointed.  Attentive staff and nice ambiance. We had the jumbo lump crab and hot pepper appetizer, nothing jumbo lump about it, Was mediocre as well as the antipasto cheese platter.  Disappointed it the main courses as well. We had the lobster ravioli, which was quite small and covered with shrimp. Tasted mostly like ricotta.  The lamb chops which were quite small as well. One was practically rare the other was well done. After being asked I requested medium. The two desserts we delicious. Which were complimentary Bc of the lamb chops being not as I requested.
