This was my first experience with soup dumplings, and I will say I am inclined to eat them more after trying them from Dim Sum Garden.
I ordered the Pork and Crab meat dumplings, which is about 8 dumplings for around $7. This was a very filling, delicious and wholesome meal for  very low price. However, if this is a place you want to go sit down and relax for some dumplings, I would not recommend. The restaurant was a bit stuffed and not very clean/ looked after. The servers were a mix of very polite and very rude. This is a CASH ONLY restaurant but it DOES HAVE AN ATM. 

If you are just looking for somewhere to get a good, unique, filling, cheap meal, this is the place for you!
