Difficult place to review. I want to give more stars, and yet, given the choice, there are simply other places I would visit first. I've been here 4-6 times: dine-in, call ahead / take-out, and ordered to-go / waited. Atmosphere seems visually interested with all of the hand painted simon signs, but sort of fast food feel. I still recommend this place to locals in the area, but if you don't have the time to wait or the cash to burn, continue on to your other favorite local poboy shop. If you're introverted, just order take out; dine-in is all picnic, group style dining tables with a very small parking lot. Super casual environment where people are happy to be New Orleanians enjoying meeting strangers over their lunch period. Still, there feels like something is missing when I'm here and so I don't come back more often. We usually end up here when we're in the area and hungry, or when my husband is craving the duck poyboy. 

First big issue is that the wait is extremely long, irrelevant of when you visit or how many other customers are there. Second, the food is good, and yet still feels pricey. Third, the service is - well, feels like fast food - they're nice, but you're ordering from someone at the counter; it's not full table service though that's what you feel like you're paying for when you're here (yes they bring your order to you, but you fill your own drinks like any fast food restaurant and no one is coming back to check on you like a full service wait staff). Again, if you've never been here, go ahead and give it a shot. This place is definitely worth a visit or two to try some of their unique menu items.
