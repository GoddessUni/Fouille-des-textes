We came here last Saturday afternoon with the kids around 2:30. The restaurant had two other tables full of people. We were quickly seated. After scanning the menu, the kids decided they wanted the breakfast sausage and the side of fruit. We asked our server if the sausage was gluten free and she said she had to ask. She came back and said no, so we went with the turkey bacon. I ordered the huevos rancheros minus the chorizo, hubby the cheese pizza. The huevos dish started with two fried corn tortillas, topped with bland refried beans, bland cheese, salsa and then topped with two fried eggs. It was good, different than any other huevos dish ive ever had. Hubby really like the pizza, thin and crispy crust with a good sauce and good cheese. The kids love the turkey bacon and the fruit plate was pretty yummy. Overall, it was just okay. I would go back if they maybe had more gluten free options.
