I'm staying here for business because I prefer Starwood and we get a good rate. Plus I like the more modern look of the W-type hotels. The staff has been very friendly and the rooms nice and clean. I also am more than a little bit in love with the Bliss toiletries....The desk is big - great for the business traveler, and the bed is very comfortable.

I just wish the damn wireless would work. I can't get it to connect and when I finally do - it drops me. I've tried to watch NetFlix Instantly over the LAN line and even that is terribly slow. If it were free, maybe I wouldn't complain, but seriously, why pay 14.95 for non-existent wireless and slow LAN connections? I expect more from a nice hotel like this, especially one that has a lot of business travel.
