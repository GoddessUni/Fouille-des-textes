Decided to go here on a whim because we wanted to try something new instead of the same old places.  Yikes!  We should have stayed with the same old places.

My wife ordered a special dish of the day which was Southern Fried Scallops.  I tried the Stuffed Shrimp and we had Fried Oysters for an appetizer.  We have firmly concluded that they have no idea how to cook seafood!

The scallops and shrimp were overcooked, rubbery and largely tasteless.   

The shrimp also came with lemon flavored mashed potatoes; and they messed those up as well.  They tasted more like mashed potatoes that someone spilled the lemon juice on.  When you make lemon zest mashed potatoes you use a heavy dose of heavy cream and butter...both were sadly missing so it was just nasty.

Service was mediocre but the place has a nice ambiance.  We'll probably go back to see if they know how to cook a pizza or something simple like a burger, but this place is off the list for anything else in our opinion!
