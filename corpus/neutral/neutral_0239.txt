I came here on a Saturday evening for an early dinner with a friend and thought it was okay.

We each ordered a beer off the modest Draft List. I ordered the Veggie Burger (southwestern spiced black bean patty topped with pickled red onions, sliced avocado, lettuce, and tomato) with house fries. The burger was okay, but nothing special.

We were sitting at 1 of only 3 occupied tables at the time, but the service was not great; our server was not particularly warm or friendly.

Tipsy Bistro is super close to my office, so I'll probably be back to try a different vegetarian dish, and I hope that experience is better.
