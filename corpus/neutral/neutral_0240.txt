Super ok. I will rate everything individually below:

Parking - decent. The lot was small but there weren't many people there despite the fact that it was a Friday night

Ambiance - I like the decor but it's a huge space and there was hardly anyone there on a Friday night. 

Service - wonderful. Our waitress was friendly and attentive. 

Drinks - very good. The original old fashioned and their Prosecco were both delicious. 

Pate appetizer - bland and flavorless. Not worth the calories. No flavor whatsoever and very disappointing. 

The burger - meh. The bun was stale and gross so I removed it. The burger patty and toppings were good but it was a little over cooked. Not the biggest deal, I order medium but it came out medium well. Still tasty but as I was eating it without a bun, it was more like meatloaf than a burger. The fries accompanying the burger were cooked perfectly but utterly flavorless. I'm not sure if they ran out of salt that night but these too were way under seasoned. 

In summary, this place is really not worth it. I would recommend grabbing only a drink or skipping all together
