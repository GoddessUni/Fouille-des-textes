How anyone can come to New Orleans and not go to one of Emeril's restaurants is beyond me.  It was the grand finale of our vacation and we were expecting epic levels of creole calories.  

We were seated on the second floor next to a group of extremelyy loud women.  We ended up yelling at each other across the table, which didn't make for a pleasant ambiance. As appetizers we ordered the crab cakes and Emeril's famous bbq'd shrimp.  I'm not a huge fan of crab cakes, so I thought they were just okay. The shrimp were classic, but I was disappointed about the size of the corn bread...I want my own platter of it, not just a little popover! How in god's name are 4 people supposed to split that??

I had 2 sides as my entree--some sauteed shrimp and a caprese salad and mashed sweet potato's. FINALLY, I have found sweet potato's in New Orleans. I devoured the potato's on my own and enjoyed the shrimp. The salad was typical, nothing unique.

At this point at NOLA, I was feeling truly disappointed. This was the New Orleans king of cooking!  Why am I not completely blown away? Enter dessert.  What started off as my friend and I sharing a dessert ended up as each of us (four total) getting our own.  We started a rotation, each taking a bit, until the desserts were all gone, not a smidge left on the plate! My warm ooey gooey cake was top notch.  The bourbon pecan pie was truly creole and my friend loved the creme brulee trio. I can't remember the fourth dessert, so it must not have been up to par with the other three.  If I had to base my review solely on the desserts, it would be 5 stars hands down, but taking into consideration all of the other dishes, its just A-OK.  If you want a truly fantastic meal, have dinner at Mr.B's and dessert at Emerils...ahh how lucky those N'awlins are!
