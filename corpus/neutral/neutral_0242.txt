The chili is famous, according to the menu, but on this sunny Sunday afternoon, the Iron Door was famous for the bees which closed down the back patio. We got a table inside and after a slight delay we were met by the witty older waiter who also doubles as the town water director (supposedly). The mountain water did taste fresh and we were reprimanded in a nice way for asking for lemons. Anyway, the waiter was nice even giving me a free cup of the chili to sample. Personally, I did not care for the namesake dish because it was too spicy and watery and it also lacked meat according to my dining companion. My dish was a basic chicken quesadilla for about 10 bucks, but it had good chunks of white meat and all the dips needed to make it a good main course. The place could use a good dusting and a beekeeper, but it has history, a funny waiter and decent enough food depending on your love of chili to warrant a visit.
