I've always been a  fan of Acropolis, but for some reason, this time it just didn't hit the mark. We went on a Friday for lunch, and service was just sub-par. It took a long time to get just about anything - drinks, bread, our orders taken, etc. Once we got our food, it was definitely delicious. I always get the chicken souvlaki, which never disappoints. This time, I ordered a side of fries as well, which were tasty. They are the long fat steak fries. They were a little soggy, and probably could have been cooked just a little longer. I'm not going to let one so-so experience affect my thoughts of Acropolis. I've always enjoyed it other than this time.
