I don't understand all the hype from hypeville. Circles is really not that good and a previous reviewer said the food is very Americanized. Yep, they hit the nail on the head. I don't need to see cheese steak rolls on a Thai menu, we have Pat's and Geno's for that. I've had the red curry, pumpkin curry, pad thai and pad see ew. There is a strange flavor that I cannot pin point that over powers the food.  Maybe it's too much galangal or tamarind, I don't know I'm not Thai but I know there is a weird flavor I just don't like. Also, you have to make your own Thai iced tea at the table where they bring out simple syrup and tea; can you just make it for me? I really wanted to like this place but it's not for me.
