We love visiting during the day, but the biggest issue for us personally is ambiance. The food and beer is expensive for casual dining without having an inviting stay for a while atmosphere. Our biggest issue is that the lights are SO BRIGHT at night that it feels a tiny little bit like a fast food restaurant and not a place you'd like to stay and have a conversation over several beers. Maybe a have a beer and leave kind of place. The staff is welcoming, friendly and they seem invested! I think this place could do very well with just a few tweaks. I will say that the hot chicken is a great choice, but many others have been hit or miss--and some consistently cold. Regardless, we will be returning and supporting our neighborhood bar!
