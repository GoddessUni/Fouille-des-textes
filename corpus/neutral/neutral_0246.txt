American comfort food with a wonderful modern twist. The burrata and radish appetizer is fresh and unique, and the classics (cornbread, pulled pork) are done with both a nod to their roots, and a nod to new perspective. I could eat the panzenella salad with brisket ends every day of my life. The cocktail list boasts one of Boise's few well made sazeracs, and the wine list has something for everyone. Great vibe, with the smell of smoking meat wafting over diners. 

When Gridiron is having a great night, I wouldn't hesitate giving 4 stars -- the only reason I'm giving three stars is consistency. When they're off, it can be mediocre. Small kitchen, big ideas...probably just growing pains.
