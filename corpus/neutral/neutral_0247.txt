OK, back I went again because of a convenient distance between a friend and I.  Bones was never a place to look forward to, or eat at, just a good clean bar to meet some friends where the company is and always will be better than the dining experience.  So expecting the worst of bar food, I found that they had finally gotten to an above mediocre level.  

First of all, happy hour app's were all $5, about half price than normal, but the same size.  We ordered a bunch. The gigantic bowl of drunken mussels came in a very edible broth with leeks, the leeks could have been more sauteed or wilted, they were still raw/crunchy, like it was an after thought to add them to the mix.  But the mussels were tender and tasty.  The wings in a sweet chili sauce were a full portion (again, for $5), crispy not wet, and something I would definitely re-order, for I am a wing lover and they have to be a 7 or better on a 1-10 scale before I would take a second shot.  The fried onion rings were perfect, crisp, great size and sweet.  The ahi tuna app had an interesting asian type slaw, creative and flavorful.

A decent, but modest selection of bottled and tap beers, and a good $2 price for domestics during happy hour.  They had other beer specials too, like for NCAA basketball last night, and I remember they have Phillies specials during season, etc.

Overall, a good atmosphere to meet friends, apps that are at a great price and have decent flavor, a definite improvement over the last time I was there in the early fall.
