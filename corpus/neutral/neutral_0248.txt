We visited once before and they had live music, several tables, and a decent crowd. We popped in yesterday and when we noticed the layout had changed and we were the only customers, were told that they've switched the focus to wholesaling.  No traditional wine tasting and no more live music. 

There were still a couple of tables, and we could buy a bottle to drink in the store, but certain wines weren't available for tasting, nor could we purchase by the glass. We ended up buying a bottle of Cabernet which we didn't end up loving. We each had a glass, and packaged the rest to take home. It was just too quiet in there. 

If they offered a local winery/tasting room experience with a full wine tasting (even charging a tasting fee), snacks, a food truck, or at the very least a fun conversation with the server, it wouldn't matter if they didn't have the best wines. But as an empty, quiet shop we probably won't be returning. 

Sad, because we have several fun breweries in the area and this could have been a nice addition for those of us who prefer wine over beer.
