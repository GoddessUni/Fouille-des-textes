I've tried the roast pork w/ provolone and rabe and the meatball sandwich with provolone. 

I imagine it's almost a crime to say this given all the love it's gotten, but I don't think the roast pork sandwich here is that good. It's not by any means a bad sandwich nor is it really a ripoff - it's expensive but very large, the roll is good and the provolone is good, and nobody reasonable would complain if you handed them one of these sandwiches - but the key ingredient, the roast pork, just doesn't have much flavor. It's relatively dry and tasteless to me. The provolone and the greens in addition to the roll are what really save the sandwich and give it some needed flavor. But the meat itself is the weak point in my opinion, and for a sandwich to be properly considered among the best around, the main ingredient should be spectacular.

I find the meatball sandwich to be better than the roast pork. I don't think it's going to blow your mind if you make good meatballs yourself, but it's a very good sandwich. Once again the portion is pretty huge.

So overall I don't think DiNic's makes bad sandwiches. They don't, the sandwiches are decent. But I think the hype is too extreme. These aren't among the best sandwiches in the country.
