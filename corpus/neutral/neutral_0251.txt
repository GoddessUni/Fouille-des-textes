Don't come to NOLA for BBQ, don't do it to yourself. 

Locals would admit that New Orleans is not particularly known for its BBQ. It's a rarity in New Orleans, as there are only 3-4 restaurants to even get it in the area. 

Blue Oak, in Mid-City, nearby to City Park as well as a couple other popular restaurants, is one of the few BBQ options in NOLA.

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, with good music, and a full bar.

They do not accept take-out orders over the phone currently. So, you go in, get on line, and place your order as you can watch the open kitchen through the window.

When all is said and done, the brussel sprouts side is a bit overdone and flavorless. The meat portions are pretty small and not very flavorful. The brisket lacked smokiness, and was a tad too fatty.

The BBQ sauces on the side were average, my favorite being the spicy Carolina.

The BBQ found in NOLA, albeit is pretty good, is an obvious poor imitation of Texas BBQ.
