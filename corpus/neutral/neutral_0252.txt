As a visitor to New Orleans, i wanted to try a local, non-chain, casual place to eat. The cafe is fairly small but it does have extra outdoor space to eat. On Thursday around 6pm, the cafe wasn't very crowded but the service was slow. The waitress said there were only 2 waitresses on duty. In fact, I saw several couples waiting at the door to be seated but they finally left after not getting helped. 
I ordered the roast beef po boy. It was very good although the waitress spilled my wife's order  all over the floor when she brought it. They made her a new po boy very quickly and apologized several times. 
Overall, the food was good but service was slow.
