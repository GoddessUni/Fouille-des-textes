Food was good, service missed the mark. They were dead so I know that it wasn't because our server was busy.  

Walked right in and seated. Took a bit for the server to come over and take our drink order. Took those eventually and came back a bit later to take our food order.  I ordered the avocado grilled chicken sandwich with no bun and a side salad instead of fries, hubs got the smokehouse meal with a side salad and daughter got the Cajun chicken pasta.  Also ordered chips and salsa as an appetizer.  Would've liked the salad to come out before the main meal but it came out along with it.  Never came to check on us, another server actually brought me the extra ranch I needed since no sauce was on my entree. Just because I order no bun doesn't mean I don't want the sauce. When we eventually came by my hubs had to ask her for drink refills as my daughter and I were completely out of water. 

Menu is via QR code scans. Masks are required and they do seem to be social distancing. You can also pay at your table like you've been able to in the past as well.
