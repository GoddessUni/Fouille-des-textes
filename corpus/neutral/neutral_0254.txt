This place was about what I expected. We went for Drag N Brunch, and were immediately seated alone in a separate room from the show. Thankfully, the queens do walk through all the rooms, and our room did fill up, but it's still not a good layout for such an event. The service was excellent as were the drinks. The food was decent, but pricey, however portion sizes were pretty large. Overall, the whole event seemed a little less fun than I was expecting. On another note, we asked our server to break a larger bill for us. When he returned, we counted the money and he actually took a dollar from us. Like ok. We were also charged $10 for the regular Bloody Mary while the menu stated $9. Some shady stuff going on here. We most likely won't be back.
