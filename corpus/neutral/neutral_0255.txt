I came here to return  shelves , customer service was fine even so not having a receipt for it so gift card was cool. Bad after I wanted to buy a few things I needed it's a Saturday nite and one cashier for the 10 items or less and one other. I was hoping Audubon would be better than the one close to where I live but it's not. Def they need more cashiers and after waiting in line for 15 min I left my stuff, I am having a bad pain day and just could not wait . Def, mgt needs to get on the ball cause it's aggravating when u can't find something and inventory is not that great but sorry no excuse for trying to save money by having 2 cashier's . Very disappointed. 
But Nicole in customer service handled the return quick and kudos to her. .
