Came in for a late breakfast after a late night. At 11am the place was very busy. Very nice hostess sat us in about 15 minutes.
My wife ordered the Eggs Cochon and a black velvet pancake. I got the Southern breakfast with a side of pork sausage.
Maybe we were expecting more from what we had read.
My dish was somewhat cold. The grits had no flavor and the sausage was unappealing with a very tough casing.
My wife's dish was okay but the pork was a little cold and the Hollandaise sauce tasted a little different than most we have had.
