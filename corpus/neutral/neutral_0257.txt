Hmmmm.... I can never figure this location out. Sometimes, I have ok service and sometimes I have not so great service, but never have I had 5-star superb service - that is why I give this location a 3-star rating. 

O'Charley's as a whole I think I enjoy, pretty good menu pricing and the rolls are quite frankly why people come... so thats pretty good. Prices are pretty middle of the road. So I cant complain there - my concern with this location specifically, is the service - its just not 100%.

So I always re-adjust my expectations. I go when I dont have anything else to do, just in case things take extra long. The Unlimited chicken strips are pretty good along with their salads! 

So ok service but nothing to rant or rave about.
