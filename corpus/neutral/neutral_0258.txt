I stopped here with my party of 4 for a quick bite to eat while doing some Christmas shopping.  We were seated as soon as we walked it since there were plenty tables available. 

Service was just ok, it would have been a little better if our server wasn't doubling as a bartender.  He seemed a bit over worked juggling both sides.  Rather than wait for our drink refills we opted on walking up to the bar instead of waiting on the server.

The food was pretty good!  I ordered the classic burger and the table shared fries and onion rings.  The onion rings were excellent but the zesty onion ring sauce had a kick to it.  I think they may have gone a bit overboard on the horseradish.  My burger was really under cooked which was a bit of a turn off but it was juicy and did have a nice flavor.   

I would like to visit again to try some of their other apps & burgers.
