Let's start with our first drinks off the rip when our scantily dressed bartender made our rum runner with pickle juice instead of rum. Not only was she completely unapologetic about it but literally laughed in our faces about it and giggled with her coworker about how funny it was. 

We've also come to realize that the bands they have there now mostly cater to house music which kind of sucks. Not a fun place to go and dance. 
The band nofilter was playing and they sucked too. 

For a $10 rcover I wish it would've been better music . Every mixed drink we ordered was made differently which is frustrating when you're paying almost $8 for a Margarita made with the cheapest alcohol ever. 

Will not return anytime soon.
