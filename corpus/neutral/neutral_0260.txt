Just your typical high priced bistro restaurant.  Service was very good and would be rated 5 stars however the food just does not cut it.  I ordered the steak blue cheese flatbread. The blue cheese was excellent however hardly any steak on it and it was dry and not hot when it arrived. My boyfriend ordered the Angus burger. It looked so small more like a hockey puck. No flavor definitely don't order that. Our neighbors got the lobster bisque.  More like lobster broth. She did not see one piece of lobster in it.  Big disappointment. Her husband ordered the salmon Rice Bowl. I will say that was the best thing and looked very appetizing. We also ordered the Ahi Tuna appetizer. Very fishy and dry. I doubt we'll be back.  They definitely need to step it up with the food to compete with so many other restaurants in the area.
