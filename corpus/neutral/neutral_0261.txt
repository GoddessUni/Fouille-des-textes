I'm shocked I can't go higher for a review here. The hype is just NOT worth it. You know it's not amazing when my favorite thing was the fresh soup at the market table.

They boast that they constantly walk around with meat, but that's not true. When you're first ready to have meat, you get bombarded all at once and then no one ever came back to us for seconds. We had to ask to get more meat.

The meat itself though didn't blow me away. I liked the sirloin the best oddly enough but even that wasn't wonderful and didn't blow me away. I truthfully like sirloin from Texas Roadhouse better. The chicken was dry too. The Market Table was nice but you're not there to pay and eat veggies. I just don't see how this place is worth the hype especially with the huge price tag. I'm glad I tried it but don't think I would go back.
