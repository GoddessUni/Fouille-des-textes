Sooo first I'd like to say that everyone I went with loved their food, so I could be the odd one out here. But, idk, I honestly felt v underwhelmed by the food and thought it was a bit bland?Â¿ The atmosphere is cool. Although it seemed like the hostess was trying to talk us out of eating here because she told us for a large party (there were 5 of us) we may be seated apart and across the restaurant from each other at that. Strange? Luckily, we ended up getting seated together. I'd go back if someone else wanted to, but honestly wouldn't initiate it myself. 3 stars for the cool atmosphere, plus I like their cocktail menu and the food menu too (lots of cool and fun options even if it does come out a lil bland--half my fun is looking at the menu!) 

Xoxo,

Is this thing on?
