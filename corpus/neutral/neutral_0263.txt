Idk, im just not getting it. Youre named the buffalo house and the buffalo sauce aint nothing crazy. Anyway, My boy loves the buff chix cheesesteak but it just tastes regular to me. I ordered the bbq cheesesteak cause i was high one time. It was super weird. Cheesesteaks aint meant to be bbq. That was my fault though. 

And whats up with the emo sad robots that answer the phone?? I feel like im bothering them every time i call to order. I actually got put on zoloft after talking to them. I feel like they have a remote call center they answer from, and the location is a sad teenagers bedroom full of hot topic stuff. "Ted, dont talk about how you hate your life, just take their order and email us their name and address and order"

I once ordered wings from there and as i waited 50 minutes from the delivery, i had to put on a comedy to put myself back into a good mood.

Anyway, the food is regular. Not bad, not good. The rolls are fresh.
