I've lived down the street from this location for awhile and always wanted to go, today was that day. 
I ordered a steak sandwich. It was good overall except I felt like a flavor was missing and I noticed my sandwich was missing the shoestring onions which would have been awesome and I imagine would have filled that flavor void. I would've asked for them to add them if my waitress ever showed up. she took our order and came by as soon as we received our food and once when she gave us the bill. Hence the three star rating. My husband ordered a grilled cheese burger which he enjoyed but I was unimpressed but he  was happy. The drinks were large. I enjoyed the atmosphere and they seem to have great happy hour offerings. I will be back for sure and hope to add some stars.
