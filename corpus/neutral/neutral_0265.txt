Food is decent. Ive eaten here probably a dozen times and it is hot and miss. 

Atmosphere is pretty terrible. Its like a bar for the retirement county (i call south county retirement count bc of all the fing old people). 

Service. Hit or miss. Last time i was served stiff drinks. This time i was served soda with a splash of rum. 

Had to order a double and it was 5.50 for a rum and coke during their special. Pretty much a rip off considering it's supposed to be a special. 

Bar definitely smells bad and the actual bar is pretty sticky gross. 

If in the area you are better off hitting helens unless your living in a retirement home. Come here.
