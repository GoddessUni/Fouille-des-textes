This place could be so much better! It has to be the only place that doesn't accept credit cards! It is small and looks really dirty. I mean the floors and tables are so outdated. The floor is also really dirty so I could never ever eat in. The lady who took my order was rude, but I really think that's just who she is and doesn't realize that she is rude. The staff that work there dress like they all just came in off the street! With all that being said the food is really , really good. I just wish they would make some changes. They are also open late every night.
