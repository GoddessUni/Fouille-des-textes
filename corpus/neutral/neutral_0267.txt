In town to run a marathon the next morning, I stopped here mainly because it's next to the filling station - which is a great place to get local beer. 

The process of getting food is somewhat cafeteria style. You order at a counter, get a number, and seat yourself. But your food is brought out to you. They have a separate bar if you want to get an adult beverage, which can be enjoyed with your meal. They had plenty of local beers on tap as well as a cocktail menu. 

I was told by a Nashville local that there are 3 places to go for Bbq in Nashville, and this was one of them. I was told to go to this place for the sides. I opted for the pulled pork platter and my wife had the pulled pork sandwich. Between the two of us, we tried the following sides: Mac n cheese, grits, cornbread, and bean salad. 

Without a doubt, the best thing I had was the bean salad. I can't say any of the other sides blew me away, but I left saying that if we came back I would be ordering a pint of bean salad as my meal. It's that good.
