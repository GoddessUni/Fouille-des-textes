We sat right down. Our waitress was rude. I had a made a comment to my kids that I didn't want them drinking all their milk so she (the waitress) took it upon her self to not bring my kids milk. Finally when their food comes she's brings it explaining (while mocking me) she heard what I said about them not drinking it all up. Anyways that wasn't her place she should have brought the drinks out with everyone's. The food was okay I swear my biscuits were underdone. The bacon was pretty Amazing and the cinnamon roll pancakes. 35.00 left full but annoyed.
