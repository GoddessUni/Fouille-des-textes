We tried Pearl Street for Devour Downtown -- we wanted to try somewhere new that we'd never been before.  Turns out that what we ordered totaled less than the $30 for 2 deal -- Tuesday is Pint Night.  (And yes, they charged us the lower amount)

We ordered a few pints, the Crab Bread and the Honey Mustard Chicken pizza.  

The Crab Bread was interesting -- I was a bit skeptical on the cocktail sauce pairing, but I gave it a try.  Nice and spicy, a pleasant surprise. Not bad. A word of warning: the crab mix that they put on the bread seems to be a creamy (mayo?) base salad. I'm always a bit worried when someone takes a mayo base product, adds cheese, and bakes/broils it.  Hot mayo really grosses me out. The order we got was not too hot, so I didn't have any issues with it, but to be honest, I might be reluctant to order it again just out of fear that it would be over-done.  

The Honey Chicken pizza was good; not the typical pizza we usually order, but we wanted something lighter and this hit the spot. Not really anything mind-blowing, but delicious. 

Service was friendly; prices are fair. I'd say Pearl Street is A-OK.
