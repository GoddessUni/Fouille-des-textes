food is ok. it satisfies the craving for chinese cuisine and the price is unbeatable. This place is a block away from my job so on the days i cant leave the office for even a second, i order in. My only issue with the service ...i ordered for delivery and the drver called me and told me he was on the corner and to come get it.  when i told him i couldnt leave the office, he gave me an attitude and told me he would come to the door.......which is still far enough from my office to where i couldnt even go. I paid the fee for delivery! I'm not coming to get it....a few more feet and i would have been able to just order for pick up!
