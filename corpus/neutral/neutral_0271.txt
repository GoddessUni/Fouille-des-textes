We came in on a Sunday after church craving some mexican food. Party of 7 and we were seated right away. We really admired the decor because it really felt like we were in Mexico and it was nice because it was a different setting than regular restaurants. 

The menu was given and our drinks were taken and brought to us promptly. There was a good variety of choices on the menu, such as enchiladas, tacos, plates, seafood, ceviche, dessert, PLenty of drinks, lots of appetizers and so on. We ordered our food. 

Chips and salsa was brought to the table, since we were starving we finished it fast, they refilled it quickly too. Salsa was good. Tasted freshly made from there. 

Our food came out fast, everyone really enjoyed their dishes. My father in law finished his entire burrito and pretty much everyone else finished theirs. I had, I think it was called Camarones al Diablo. Something like that. Its supposed to be spicy. But it wasnt spicy at all. I was hoping it would be, but thats okay, the sauce was very flavorful and it was delicious.

Only downfall was that pieces of the rice was hard, which was unpleasant. But overall it was a okay experience. I will visit when I have a mexican food craving again. There are a few dishes I still want to try.

Btw the Fried ice cream is delicious!

Good service, good food, strong margaritas and nice change in atmosphere.
