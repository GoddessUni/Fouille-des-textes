Attended the guitar show at the oaks convention center saw that the old max and irmas was now ph whelihans and decided to give it a try 

The remodel was very nice although the air conditioning seemed to be struggling   There were a couple of dozen large screen tvs catering to the a d d crowd along with an acoustic guitarist in the bar area.  Happy to see live music even in less than optimal conditions 

Food menu was limited  one person had ribs he enjoyed them another a specialty burger again prepared well , fish and chips were fine as well as my shrimp tacos although I have to admit I don't understand why the shrimp were fixed up. For starters we had crab dip that was very tasty and an order of wings that I was told were good 

Over all service was ok nothing special the food average chain fair not a cut above or below 

It is convenient to the convention center

It is very loud in there tough to hold a conversation
