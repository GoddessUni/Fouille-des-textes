The best part about this restaurant is most definitely the service.  From the lovely hostess who greeted us at the door and shared some of her menu favorites to our server, Tyler.  We ordered bourbon old fashioneds and to our disappointment, the bartender had no clue how to make them. Thankfully, when we told Tyler, he was so understanding (not defensive) and immediately sent Ryan over.  Ryan remade our drinks himself and did a beautiful job.  The appetizers were mediocre at best.  The ceasar salad was limp and the croutons seemed stale.  The best part about the bruschetta was the gorgeous olive oil they used but the pistachios overwhelmed the entire dish.  The shrimp fettuccini was pretty good.  Nothing to write home about but "reliable."  The wagyu burger was by far the best part of the meal. Phenomenal burger.  I don't think we would ever return but I must say, the service was on-point.  We really appreciated how the folks working there made up for the mediocre meal.
