The food is great! Staff is nice however there is zero online ordering or delivery options!! WHYY??? Getting in and out of that area can be hard and at lunchtime, I often decide its not worth the fight if I haven't ordered ahead. Phone orders are the only way to go. You would think an online ordering system would be in place to keep the orders rolling so staff facing the public at the register can take orders and expedite the flow. 

Regardless of the order method or size it seems like it often takes a while to get the order complete. Go there with time and patience and you will get great food and reasonable portions. Although 4 dollars for a couple pieces of extra bacon seems a bit high.
