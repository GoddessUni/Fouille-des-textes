This is a super cute place with lots of tea and teapots as well as all things English, as expected. You can also come and be served a cup of tea, but only during certain times of the week, if I remember correctly. It's a pretty small space and it's filled to the brim with items, some cute, some kind of kitschy. 

I didn't appreciate how there was one older male employee who was very obviously following my friend and I around the store as we were browsing. Did he expect to catch us stuffing something small into our purses or something? I'm not sure why we appeared suspicious to him, but I took off a star for that because no one else was being followed.
