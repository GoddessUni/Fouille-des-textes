Not really sure what to think of this place. The decor, ambiance, and service were great. However the drinks and food we ordered were mixed.

Drinks- the cat in the hat and southern bell's handbook were good. We then ordered the unholy night. It was recommended by our waitress and she said it tasted like a pina colada. It was one of the worst drinks we've ever tasted, with hits of cherry, sweet and spice, bitterness, and no pineapple flavor (it was taken off our bill). 

Food- the house made burrata cheese was delicious, adding orange and coriander honey made a difference to this otherwise simple dish. We then ordered the beet salad, which was standard but large for an appetizer. Then we got the poblano dumplings, which were horrible- they lacked texture and taste and were overall weird (these were also taken off our bill). And lastly the grilled cheese was subpar and the bottoms were stuck to some paper they put on the bottom of the plate it was served on (??).
