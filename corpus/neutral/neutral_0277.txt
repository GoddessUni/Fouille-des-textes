The Mike Duffy's of Richmond Heights is quite similar to the Mike Duffy's of Kirkwood in many respects. Basic pub food, dark wood, tvs tuned to sports, karaoke once a week, etc. But despite that, I've found myself preferring this location lately. It feels a bit more welcoming, there aren't odd rooms to sequester yourself in, and the actual bar has more breathing room around it. Bartenders are really friendly here.

Naturally, I go here mainly for the karaoke, which happens every Tuesday night. The crowd here is more relaxed and inviting than the one in Kirkwood, and they'll smile and cheer for you even if they've never spoken to you. The patrons are a mix among dad-age sports fans and Washington University students, with the latter being the larger group. They're not douchey frat boys, but these guys aren't afraid to have fun, singing Weird Al, Radiohead and Elton John with gusto. It honestly doesn't matter if people can't sing well here - all are cheered.

I've nibbled the nachos when I've come here late without dinner. They were typical bar nachos, but they were inexpensive and the salsa was pretty tasty. I haven't eaten regular food here, but friends have ordered the fried mushrooms, and they looked ok. However, another friend left his baked pretzel stick unfinished.

Disclaimer: The man who runs karaoke here employs me to DJ at another bar. I began to visit this location on Tuesdays to learn more DJ tricks from him, but I've also brought friends here on my own.
