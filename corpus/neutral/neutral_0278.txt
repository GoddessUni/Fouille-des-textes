First time EVER visiting a Qdoba. Luckily it was around 9pm and I wasn't holding up the line because I definitely had a hard tome trying to figure out what I want. I stood in line for about 4 mins before I decided that I wanted a quesadilla. Took me another minute or so to figure out what I wanted to put in it because the ingredients were a little messy, which I could understand being that it was pretty late. Opted for chicken, tomatoes, queso, shredded cheese, black beans and fajita veggies.

I wasn't really a fan of the chicken and I think it had something to do with the seasoning. The chips were different too. Guacamole was pretty delish and their queso was note worthy as well. I think my main problem was that I kept comparing it to the other Mexican fast casual spot that starts with a "C". They stood their ground, but it doesn't top it to me *insert shrugging shoulder emoji*.

I'd come back to try other things on the menu though.
