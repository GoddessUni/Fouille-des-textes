This loose leaf tea shop is pretty much like all the others. The tea is good. Get talked into actually buying a ceramic teapot, or tea accouterments and quietly resign into poverty for the rest of your life. Kinda weird to have "tea pushers" here unlike the other places where they actively place a taster cup into your hands and try immediately to up sell you. Pressure aside it's just OK. I don't love tea enough to spend a hobbies price on it, but may be good for a gift. Perhaps for that tea-loving Englishman in your life who still insists on tea time in the foyer with family who no longer exists in this century. Just saying.
