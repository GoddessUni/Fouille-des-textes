The service.. So disappointing. You would think that if you go to a good restaurant, being nice to your waiter and have a full expensive meal (400 for 4 ppl) - the service will be spectacular.. apparently not at Treemont. From start to finish..

We asked about the wine, I guess the fact that the wine price was on the cheap  side - the waiter referred us to more expensive one that was far from the type of wine we were interested in..

Our drinks took really long to arrive - couple min before we received our appetizers, all thought we order them way before we ordered our food. - not sure why purring wine will take forever; the more complicated drinks - I kinda understand. 

Then we received the appetizers: chickpea fritters  - so good, the special charred octopus salad, was prepared really nice as well, Hen devil eggs - mediocre at best and cured cobia - sooooo tasty!! the portion is not big or small - its just right, the issue is that our waiter decided to clear our table before we finish our food without even asking if we are done which was really rude especially consider the portion factor (5 pcs of cobia - he took it when there were 2 left.), bizarre.

Then entrees: the Amish chicken is reach with flavors, Golden Tile Fish - right up my alley :) and the Parisian-Style Gnocchi - tasty but had really weird texture and kinda remind us tater tots.. 

Then we receive our dessert, which was taken by our waiter half full which kinda made us feel that we were rushed to leave the restaurant. 

We never experienced this type of service. Food is good, but the service leave a bitter taste in your mouth. We will not go back again.
