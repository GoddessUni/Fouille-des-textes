it was super busy on a sunday night. we had a party of 4 plus a toddler and it was around a 45 minute wait. once we were seated, our server was kind but a little in the weeds and forgot a few things that we had to ask another server for.
the kpot signature soup wasn't that tasty, and i barely touched it. the BBQ meats were good. Pork belly way too fatty, the spicy pork bulgogi and the spicy beef bulgogi were both delicious. 
it's decent for an AYCE but i appreciate the quality of meat that you get from a standard authentic korean BBQ restaurant.
