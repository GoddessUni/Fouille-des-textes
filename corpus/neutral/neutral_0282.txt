Not a bad spot overall, Buho's gets a solid 3/5 stars from me. My husband and I visited for lunch this past weekend and it was very empty, but enjoyable. It's spacious with cute Mexican decor inside. Service was very friendly and attentive. 

The nachos and salsa were standard; they weren't anything out of this world.  I'm a big chip person but these were not the kind of nacho chips which drive you to binge eat them - they were just okay. 

The shrimp cervice was light and tasty, and prepared very well.  The presentation was nice, very colorful and large pieces of shrimp filled the plate. We enjoyed this the most. 

My entree, however, was mediocre and very challenging to eat. I ordered Buho's steak burrito which was massive and kept falling apart. Despite having to eat my burrito with a fork and knife, the steak inside the burrito was not seasoned at all. It literally tasted like nothing, very bland meat that was just heated up.  I had to keep adding salt to each bite to get any flavor. My husband also got the Buho burrito but drenched it in mole sauce, so he did not have a problem with flavor.   I would return again to give Buho's another shot but I think I would order a different entree, or atleast not the steak.
