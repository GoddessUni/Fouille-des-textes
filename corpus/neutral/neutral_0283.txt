I used to eat in at Bellacinos quite frequently. We always stuck with the pizza and it was pretty good.  After a hiatus I just got take-out recently - pizza, wings, and a grinder. The pizza was the greasiest pizza I've ever had. It was terrible. The box was soaked through and the crust had absorbed so much grease it was limp. And that's probably the last time I'll get pizza there.

The wings were ok. They offer hot, bbq, and teryaki (I think). They were very similar to Pizza Hut's wings. The grinder wasn't very good. It was the chicken, bacon, ranch and I could tell the chicken was the precooked, packaged stuff. Not like I expect them to make it fresh there, but still a turn-off.

My other problem is the restaurant always seems dirty. Even when there are hardly any customers in there, the tables are never wiped off and it just has a general dirty vibe. I think my Bellacino days are over.
