It's tough to make pizza stand out in Indy these days, and I admit myself biased towards thinner crust and local brands over a place like Goodfellas. But this place plays the pie game perfectly well, if at a premium price point. 

Goodfellas leans deep into its theme with its specialty pizzas and subs, with pies like "Jimmy the Gent" and "The Bootlegger." The toppings are standard pizzeria fare, with nothing out of the box. I snagged the Wiseguy, your boilerplate veggie pizza, and it was solid, though a bit basic for the price. We accented our pies with an extra large breadstick -- exactly what it sounds like, though ours was a bit tough to the chew -- and pesto bread, which I will always love in any fashion. 

You're still more likely to see me at Napolese or Bazbeaux or mourning the transformation of Pizzology, but if my pals want to grab a pie at Goodfellas any given Tuesday, I won't be unhappy about it, especially if it means a drink at the Wiseguy Lounge in the back.
