i gave this hotel 3 stars- let me tell you why.

We decided to stay during Mardi Gras (for the first time). March 6th-10th. 
Our check-in went very smoothly. No complaints.

We got into our room- immediately someone rings the door to the room (yes- there are door bells). A lady asks if she can check the mini-bar. Mind you, we JUST got into our room- luggage still on the floor, unpacked. 

My bf advises okay- and she starts pulling things out of the mini-bar asking us if we had put things in there and taken things out. We advised the lady that WE JUST GOT HERE. She noted that and started taking inventory of the mini-bar. In the meantime- we knew this was going to be a problem during check out. So my boyfriend- takes a picture of all the things she removed and put into the mini-bar for our notes, in the future. 

The next morning- 9am (still in bed), the door bell rings- mini-bar lady AGAIN. She asked if she can check the mini-bar. WHAT?!?! AGAIN?!?! We had advised her that nothing was taken out of the mini-bar. 

So then we called the front desk and asked if this is a routine? The operator said, No. So we informed her of the mini-bar lady coming into our room 2 days in a row. After that, mini-bar lady never came back.

Guess what- the morning of the day we were checking out- we get the invoice under our door. They had charged us for 4 beers and 3 waters! We knew this was going to happen!!

So my bf went downstairs and told the lady at the front we had not taken any of these items, and without hesitation, she took them off. 

What a relief!!!!! 

BTW- this hotel has an excellent location from Bourbon Street!
