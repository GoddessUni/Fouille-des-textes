THE GOOD: the food is great and the restaurant has a nice design. The music is fun without being intrusive. They have excellent vegetarian potato tacos, but the vegetarian quesadilla isn't so good. The white queso is totally worth the money, although it'd be nice if they gave enough for a party of four to share. They don't skimp too much on the sides which taste excellent. The salsa doesn't have any spice and the guacamole has zero flavor, but the chips are free.

THE BAD: Any time I have a server here who seems anything less than genuinely friendly they without exception try to add extra drinks to my bill. It's happened too many times to be coincidental. Their drinks are good, but not very strong so I don't know why they think they can get away with this. I also rarely have more than one so of course 2 extra drinks stand out on the bill. I saw this a lot at touristy places when I lived in San Diego, but this is the only restaurant in Nashville where I've experienced this. Drinks also always take about 20 minutes to arrive. I don't know what the deal is with the bar, but it's consistently the slowest bar in town. Obviously everything is overpriced. There's an identical taco spot on the beach in La Jolla, California where the house margaritas are made with Clase Azule that charges the same prices as this place. I usually share queso and tacos with my wife and we each get a drink for about $80. Parking is a block away and you have to cross a very dangerous crosswalk to get to the restaurant. I keep coming here for the food and well made margaritas, but I wish the experience was better.
