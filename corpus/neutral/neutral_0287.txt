Cake bake is cute- in its idea and its food. It kind of feels like a little girl should be having her birthday party here all the time with American girl dolls next to her. 

OR my 23 year old self had my friends come here for my birthday.. Same thing you know. 

The cake was really beautiful, but weird texture and not very sweet. The frosting was hard... But not old? It was unique- I'll Give it that, but not for a classic cake lover. 

I won't be returning here as it just isn't my scene, but it's worth going to once for a date or special occasion.
