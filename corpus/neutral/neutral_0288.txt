Disclaimer- Went here for brunch.

Atmosphere- It was weird to eat brunch in a bar. I'm not really sold on the atmosphere.

Food- My friend couldn't stop talking about her eggs benedict all day, so I assume it was good :). My challah french toast was very tasty, but nothing I haven't had before.

Price- Yeah... slightly pricely. I guess it's not really too bad for the area, but it was brunch in a bar, not tea at the Lincoln. 

Overall- I've heard their dinner menu is delicious, so I'd like to try that, but I don't think I'll be back for brunch.
