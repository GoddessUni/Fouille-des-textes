*** review updated ***

Unfortunately,  this location and experience was not up to par. The service was lacking and it took a long time to get our food. Received the drinks and not once did we get offered a refill.  I had to tell the waiter 2 times to get my grits from under the heat light after our food had already come out 30 minutes prior.  The grits were flavorless and chunky.  Never had grits so awful from any other metro diner. Then let's talk about the chicken and waffles... I don't know how old the grease was the chicken had been fried in but you could tell it needed to be changed.  The chicken was dry and tasted old.  Very disappointed since this is my go to meal. My husband had Sheppard pie and it had flavor but was soupy. So runny and strange textured. Won't order again.  My son's chicken salad was the same as the fried chicken.  Tasted like old grease. 

It's so sad that our experience was like this.  We will still visit the other Metro locations but won't come back to this one.
