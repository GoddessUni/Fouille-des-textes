I wanted to love this place :/ if I was rating just for the coffee I would put one star but I don't want to bring the business down, I hope maybe an owner sees this. I don't know if it was the coffee or the person who made it, but I ordered a late with two extra shots and it tasted like super watered down milk. It scared me from ever trying to go again. I couldn't even taste the coffee & ended up tossing it & going elsewhere. Again, I really wanted to like this place being a small business & not a chain.
