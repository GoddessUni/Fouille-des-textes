Went here with several family members last Saturday night. I started with the Mamie Taylor cocktail and an order of the Scotch eggs. These were the best parts of the night!! I would have been just as happy ordering them alone! But, for my entr√©e, I got the cock a leekie pie and I thought it was just OK. I wish there would have been more veggies or more substance to it and the salad that came along with it didn't have any flavor. Then it was time for dessert, I was not impressed by the offerings and opted to not order anything. However, my dad ended up ordering the bread pudding and the flavor that night was orange ginger and it wasn't bad. Overall, it was not a bad experience. Maybe I just didn't order the right things, because from the other reviews it is very well liked. Will have to give it another try sometime.
