I wanted to try this place so I took my husband out.  Other reviews said the place was out dated , but I really liked the place a lot reminded me of a place I ate at in Chicago.  But here is where it went down hill - we were seated next to a piece of furniture that had a marble counter / my husband looked over and almost wanted to leave , there was dried up red pasta sauce with dust and other remains of food .  No one ever cleaned it.  We ordered drinks and my husbands drink was in a dirty glass with black stuff stuck on the sides .   By then my husband wanted to leave but I talked him into staying.  Now the good part , the food was delicious thank goodness.   The salad was wonderful and my chicken marsala was good .  The sauce was a smidge too thick but it tasted good .  The hot bread and soft butter were  to die for.  My husbands pasta con broccoli was better then pasta house .  When we were leaving my husband went up to the owner to let her know the counter our table was up against was very dirty.  To be honest I don't think we will go back.
