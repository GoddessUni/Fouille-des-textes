I think this was a really nice place and very helpful staff. The pizza was fine too, I tried the thin crust and that was good. 
I think it was called buffalo chicken but I might be wrong.... anyway it tastes like hot chicken and it was all good, especially the pickles. 
Also tried the meat pizza and that was very good as well. 

The competition in this neighborhood when it comes to pizza is hard though... I do love Soulshine and their pizzas and this is not on the same level. 
And I have to compare their outdoor seating too. Soulshine has pretty lights and fun people watching, here you have a busy road and the torn down old Nashville deli place... not so sexy

The wine selection is no selection at all. It's really, really bad...
When we were there the ice machine was broken and they had ice in a bucket next to the soda machine 75% melted. And a scope, down there in the water, seemed less healthy...

Anyway. It's ok.
