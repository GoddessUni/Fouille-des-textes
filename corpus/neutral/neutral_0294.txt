I'm on the hunt for the best falafel sandwich in town. Not quite sure I've found the one yet. I read several reviews about Goldie and which items to purchase. So I stopped by Whole Goods to try a falafel sandwich, fries, and Turkish Coffee tahini shake. 
     The shake, definitely 5 stars, you can barely taste the tahini. I will be purchasing another the next time I'm there. The falafel balls were good, green and parsely full on the inside, nice and crisp on the outside. The pita bread was a bit too thick for a sandwich. So thick that it had taken away the flavor of the salad and falafel inside. I end up eating the inside of the pita with a fork and breaking off pieces of the bread  to eat. The bread was soft and warm just a little too bready inside. Next time I'll probably get the salad, with pita on the side. The fries were really short. So short I could barely dip them in the little ketchup cup. They were like little fry niblets with great seasoning.  
   I would definitely eat at Goldie again. I'll just be changing my order around a little. My plan was to eat and then grab a donut from Federal donuts, but I was sooo full the thought of donuts had disappeared.
