I've only been once, but the food I experience was pretty good. The salmon pasta and coconut shrimp were so YUM. I would be giving this rating 4 stars if it wasn't for the lousy service. Our waitress had a "mean girl" attitude, like we were bugging her. I don't think it would have hurt her to try smiling. But who knows, perhaps she was having a bad day.

My food came on time and came hot, but I can't say the same for my friends' meals. They were pretty lukewarm and one was incorrect the way it came prepared -- and they were two of the most expensive things on the specials menu. Worse yet was when they brought it up to the waitress that they were dissatisfied, instead of a "No problem, we'll fix that right away" they received a list of excuses and defensive behavior. The place didn't receive any winning points for that behavior. Then their correct meals proceeded to come out ten minutes apart. So between the three of us, we each started and finished our meals at different times.

As for the atmosphere, I didn't realize going in it would be so incredibly loud. We had a screaming baby to our left and the room was just so big and cavernous that voices carried and echoed. I may be willing to give this restaurant a second shot to impress me, but I'm not going in very confident. Perhaps other locations would have rated better.
