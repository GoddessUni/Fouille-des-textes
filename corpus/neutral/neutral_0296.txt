First visit.  Solid food, portions on the smaller side for the prices.  Wait staff friendly but not polished.

The good:  TU evening IN brewery night - 16 on tap at $3 each.  House salad was large and could be split by 2.  My wife had the lamb burger and it was tasty.  I had fish tacos - the salsa verde was worth the extra $1 charge.  Sat on the porch and enjoyed the sunset.

The not so good:  Wait staff descended immediately and asked drink orders before we had a chance to even look over the menu.  Several of the beers had been replaced, but we weren't told until asking for them.  Menu and waiter didn't point out which beers were smaller pours and which were pints (perhaps all smaller pours?).  There were dinner specials but waiter failed to tell us about them (the braised pork cheeks sounded good).  The lamb burger was ordered medium and came more well done and a bit dry (still flavorful).  The slaw component in the tacos and dressing were a bit on the light side.  

All in all a solid meal for the price, but won't knock your socks off.  The TU $3 IN tap pours is nice.
