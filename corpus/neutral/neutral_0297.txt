I use this 7/11 regularly for milk runs because it's located near my house. When the overpasses were built on California and Booth Streets, this oddly elliptical piece of land was created. Being in a good neighborhood, the store was originally owned by English-as-a-first-language types, and I liked this store a lot. They always had nonfat milk in stock and the cashiers were friendly. 

However, after a few years the store was sold to members of the Patel family, you know, the Easterners who have remade the convenience store trade and in this area at least, have come to dominate 7/11 ownership. 

Their kids tend to work here at night when the grocery stores are closed, coincidentally, the only time I come here. They are almost always talking on their cell phones cuz what's mommy going to do about it (?), or, blasting foreign music that actually isn't bad, except that I'm no fan of boom-boxes turned up full-volume at 7/11 or any other store. 

These are the reasons I have knocked down their star-rating, but parking lot is huge and maintained well and the store is always clean and seems safer than most 7/11's due to the 240 degree street view allowed by the corner location. If their fridge isn't stocked with nonfat milk or something else you need, they will go in the back and check. They have personally walked me to the location of an item I couldn't find. 

The store is well lit, and fairly new as 7/11s go, but their attitudes aren't nearly as good that exhibited by the cashiers at my favorite 7/11 on Mount Rose (Shamelessly plugging my review of that store here http://www.yelp.com/biz/7--eleven-reno#hrid:pYLdjI8y3rVrYS8Yzf89pw/src:self)

Once again. my friend Lakewood G has slacked off and I have beat him to this review. Look out LG!
