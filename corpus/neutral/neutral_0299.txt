BWW's in Brentwood is a great place to watch all your favorite sports games at one time since there are TVs literally all over the walls, every one of them, covered in TVs. 

Their chicken is good and I usually just order some boneless wings but, there service is often lacking and they do not update there beer menu often enough. We selected 4 different beers before we actually found one that was available...hmmm...and all the girl could do was laugh and blame corporate.....seriously?

Downside to going while a game is on in which people actually want to watch it is that they are PACKED. 

Overall, I don't come here often as I try to stay away from places that are too chain-y but, once in awhile it ends up being the place to watch the game.
