Sometimes I feel like dancing like I am underage in college and ladder is great for that. It is like that bar you went to at 2 am in college when you didnt have anyone (yet) to go home with.

Other times...I realize Im not supper into that anymore. Sometimes you cant even breathe in that place on fridays/saturdays.

I do think that it is great for happy hour though - nice open area (especially when it is nice out and can open the windows) and then the food is good too. I also think it is good for birthdays with the $25 wristband deal.
