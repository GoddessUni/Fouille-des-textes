Johnny Gitto's (not to be confused with Charlie Gitto's fine dining restaurant) is a casual restaurant/bar located on Chippewa on the SW edge of the City at the River Des Peres. they serve pasta, pizza and general pub grub.  It's a little dark inside and not ideal as a restaurant option.  However, their casual food is decent.  

Johnny Gittos has a 3am license and they are best known on the south side as a late night bar, featuring karaoke until 12:30 and dance music thereafter. You can expect to find lots of early 20's drunk, horny, toads after the clock strikes midnight. 

Due to the high volume of credit cards left at the bar, they do not take credit/debit after midnight, but they have an ATM on site. You will get carded, regardless of your age.

Johnny Gitto and Charlie Gitto are family, but run two completely different operations.
