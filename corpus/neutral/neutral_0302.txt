Ate here for lunch with my boyfriend during the week. We both ordered food from the lunch combos. I had the pork tacos with a house salad while my BF got the quesadillas with chicken enchilada soup. I felt the portions were the perfect size since I didn't want to eat too much before work. The ordered avocado ranch with my salad. I'm not a big fan of ranch on my salad but this one I actually really enjoyed. The tacos were pretty good but nothing special. I would have rated one star higher but they wouldn't let me get one chicken and one pork taco which bummed me out. I tried my bf's soup which I thought was flavorful. The service was really good especially since it was busy for lunch.
