Went back to El Costeno and the food's gone downhill.  Apparently they changed cooks 2 weeks ago.  Everything we ordered was SUPER SALTY.  

Tacos al pastor: extremely salty, though meat's still tender.  Not enough pineapple -- I found only 1 piece -- which is unfortunate as the sweetness & tartness would've helped balance the salt.

Guacamole: creamy, cool, and fresh, but again, very very salty.

Complimentary nachos and 2 salsas were fine, but not as flavourful as I remember.

I'd been looking forward to these tacos so it was disappointing. We told the waitress about the saltiness when she asked.  She was apologetic, and came back offering to send out another order of tacos to make up for it, but we'd had enough salt for the day.  I can't fault the attentive service & I appreciate that they wanted to make it right.  So, I'll drop one star for the food being overly salty, and optimistically hope that the kitchen'll get things together...  Cash only.
