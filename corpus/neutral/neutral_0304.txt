A pretty average restaurant with a great lunch special, California Pizza Kitchen is always reliable, but there are better pizza places in the area.

I'll keep this one quick, as most people are familiar with California Pizza Kitchen. When I think pizza, I think New York or Chicago...not California. As such, the pizza here is just okay, but there is a great lunch combo - Lunch Size Pizza + Soup or Salad/Half Sandwich + Soup or Salad/Soup + Salad for around $10-11. I opted for the Original BBQ Chicken Pizza and the Super Spinach + Quinoa with Granny Smith apples, marinated cranberries and spiced pecans with our housemade vinaigrette. The salad was the best part - the pizza was a little burnt with overcooked ingredients. 

Overall, it's an average lunch spot that's a little overpriced other than the lunch special. If you're looking fora a far better yet similar lunch special, From the Boot is a better option.
