The people were nice, but I found a hair in my poke. I made my own and the bowl was huge but it was filled 90% with rice. The rice filled me up really quickly. I wish I had less of it and more of the toppings. You get 5 of each for the crunch and topping. Pretty pricey for a place that hardly gives you any fish. My friends got the pre-made and the bowls were smaller; the rice to fish ratio was a lot better because of it. I wouldn't recommend making your own since all you get is 90% rice.
