So I decided to try this place out I was sick of eating Thanksgiving leftovers. So my fianc√© and my one year-old decide to dine in. We order two wow wow bacon (double patty) cheeseburgers one pepperoni pizza, one order of fries and two drinks. It was ready immediately simply because it comes from warmers behind the counter....So it's okaaaay but I like my food fresh off the grill piping hot kind of style. Fries were tasty but would've been better hot. The pizza had great flavor but was a little rubbery kind of like the temperature of a hot and ready at Little Caesars. The taste was decent, I would come back, but request my food be made fresh.  Or customize it so that I know they have to cook it on the spot. Service was great btw.
