Well, I heard great things about MT. As a vegetarian, I was happy to see a burrito that looked great. Seemed good. Other places do a nice job with this idea.

Anyhow, it came with a wanna be veggie meat. I read that and so expected it. As a vegetarian for more than 40 years, trying to eat meat is really not a step up for me. I do like the Match Burger though. 

I thought the burrito needed something more so I asked for red or green sauce. The waitress put some red on top. To me, it tastes like a glorified Ketchup. I asked for something with a bit more zing and was told that the only other sauce came with the chips. So that would be an up charge. It was quite uneventful burrito and I had expectations of it really tasting great. 

I asked for regular cheese instead of the vegan and was accommodated. But I felt that it needed or could have had more flavor somehow. I'm just saying... 

Oh well, maybe I'm just not the target for the restaurant as I do not eat meat. The waitress was great though!
