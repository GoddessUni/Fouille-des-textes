Wow!  Just wow.   Came here for honeymoon dinner and we loved it!  Excellent service, cocktails, and food.  We ate on the fancy restaurant side and it fit our special occasion perfectly.  
You will not be disappointed.

Fast forward 1 year to anniversary dinner.  Tomahawk steak (that takes 40 minutes to prepare) came out half-bubbly white fat, have rare and half MW.  I took one look at it and said, no.  They profusely apologized, mind you, this steak is cut prior to service, so no excuse to serve this garbage. 
They offered to make another... and we would be eating around 10pm.  So on our anniversary we ate sides for the steak. 
Also, the 24 later carrot cake my husband was dreaming of for a year came out as a 7 layer cake.  
What happened between this year?  New chef?  Not sure we will be back
