Eggs Benedict! Gotta love it! I am almost certain that I have ordered the eggs benedict every time I have visited. It is consistently good. Comes with hash browns and fruit. 

This location has a breakfast bar in the cafe and is a nice alternative to the wait that one often has to endure. The service can be super fast or super slow at the bar, but if you flag down a server, you get to order right away. Food always comes out rather quickly too. 

The wait staff is always friendly and will give you a to go cup for your beverage, if you ask for it. 

A pitcher with water and lemons is always brought to the table or available at the bar, so enjoy :)
