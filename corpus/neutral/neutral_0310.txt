Went on our lunch break. Service was very polite and fast. 

I had the "Choose 2 Lunch" - 1/2 a club sandwich and beer cheese soup. Sandwich was really good. Soup was very salty, therefore I could only eat 1/2 of the cup. I really wanted to try the Onion Soup but they were out. But given the reviews of it I guess it is a good thing. LOL. Maybe they are revamping the recipe.

Cons: It seems their exhaust system does not work very well. The entire restaurant was filled with smoke (kitchen smoke, not cigarette smoke) We left smelling like we were the ones cooking in front of a greasy grill for hours. 

I will probably go back but will after work - so I don't have to smell like a grill all day. Or I will go on a nice day and sit on their patio... which looks nice. Give them a try!
