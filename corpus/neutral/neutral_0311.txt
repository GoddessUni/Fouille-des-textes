It was mostly good.  I think I might've just had too high of an expectation from all our steakhouse eating in CO.  Ha.  We started with the crab cakes, which were yummy.  I then got the halibut special and my hubby got the N.Y. strip special and we got a side of the creamed corn.  Caesar salads were delicious.  Bread was delicious.  Hubby said the strip was good, mashed potatoes were ok.  Creamed corn was weird, it tasted like corn inside of mac n cheese sauce.  My halibut was cooked well, but didn't have a lot of flavor.  So I had to eat it bite by bite with the risotto it came with.  For desert we ordered the peanut, Carmel, brownie, with ice cream. Not good. Brownie was super dry.  Would I go back; maybe for the crab cakes, and hubby would for the steak special.  Couldn't beat $20 for a 12oz strip, potatoes, and salad.  But just for me, unfortunately, probably not. Thanks to the staff though!
