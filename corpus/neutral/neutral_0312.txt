Carmel is not lacking with the amount of Chinese restaurants. I wasn't sure about my pick so I relied on other reviews. 

I went inside to order and wait for take-out. It was a Saturday evening around 7 p.m. Not too busy inside but the employees were really rushing around. I gave my order to the lady at the register and paid. Two eggrolls, hot and sour soup, and garlic chicken for $16.  I really was looking forward to the soup. I definitely judge a Chinese restaurant by the hot and sour soup. I can remember the first time I had it(Chan's Steakery, Milwaukie, OR) so I order it every chance I get. As I sat waiting patiently for my order to be ready, I watched the people coming and going. At least one customer showed up not knowing what he was picking up and not convinced the hostess/manager knew either. She was very impatient and it was uncomfortable to watch the confusion. My wait was not too long, thank goodness because the chaotic scene made me anxious. 
I wish I could say the food was really good but it wasn't. I felt like there was way too much celery in the garlic chicken. It was overwhelming, and I really don't remember celery in any other garlic chicken dishes anywhere else. The sauce had a good flavor after getting past the greasiness of it. Egg rolls were okay. The soup was good. Not the best but good. I would go back just for soup. It was not overly spicy like I have had in other places. I like it spicy. I like to have it when I am feeling sick or have congestion because it hits the spot. This soup was good but not "healing."
