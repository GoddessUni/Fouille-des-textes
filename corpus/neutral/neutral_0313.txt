This is a standard pool, dart, shuffle board and skee-ball bar.  They serve a ton of PA local drafts and they usually have a special.  Most of the time this is $3 pounder PA cans.  However, their Happy Hours are really what is worth being there for.  Thursdays are $3 for PA drafts - a good deal in my mind.  I like the Sly Fox Stout and that is definitely a great pour from this establishment.

Didn't try the food myself but, a friend ordered the chicken fingers and they were standard bar fare.  Likely from a bag in the freezer into the fryer and onto the plate.  Could be just right if you're in the right frame of mind.

Good place to drink with plenty of activities to keep you entertained as you socialize and drink tasty beverages.  Bar food is nothing special though but, it is edible.
