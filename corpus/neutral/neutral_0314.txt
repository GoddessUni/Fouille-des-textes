Hubby and I were out doing things on a weeknight and wanted to grab a bite. In an attempt to ditch fast food, I remembered this place had popped up on my Yelp newsfeed for selling pizza by the slice late night which is surprisingly somewhat a rarity in New Orleans. 

This spot is on the outskirts of all the downtown shenanigans so for those of us who want a single slice of pizza but aren't venturing down Bourbon with a Jester's at every corner, this is your spot! We found parking out front but granted we went on a Thursday night when it was raining. 

The vibe inside is really chill and the decor is eclectic. They had Kill Bill plying on the wall so this is a really cool spot to grab a slice, catch your breath, and shoot the ___ with your friends!

I will, however, admit that I wasn't wow-ed by the pizza. It's good but nothing to write home about. The good thing is that there are fresh pies constantly being made so just bc you don't see a pepperoni pie in the window case, there's probably one coming out the oven! 

Another thing I was surprised about was that they have no draft beer; everything seemed to be in cans (that's a lot of aluminum!!) and I don't recall seeing any bottles either. It did appear to be a full bar though! 

Probably will be back next time I get a late night hankering for a slice.. maybe I'll venture out and try one of their specialty slices that'll be more impressive!
