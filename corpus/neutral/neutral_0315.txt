Had tried to get in on several occasions and the wait time was greater than 60-90 minutes, which made us think this place must be great. We were quite disppiointed I have to say. The food was ok, not great. The noise was just so loud that it made it very uncomfortable to be there. We happened to go around 5-5:30 on a weekday figuring it wouldn't be overcrowded. We got in quickly but I almost killed myself on the peanut shells while walking to our table, wouldn't wear any kind of heels or new shoes if you are going there. Quite dangerous. Unlike other reviewers, I'd take Outback anyday. Their staff seems more well trained than the Roadhouse and more attentive and their steaks are much better.
