I ordered two orders of their poke bowls. It was okay... I chose sushi rice as the base for the bowl but when I went and tried it, it tasted like plain white rice :/ they must've either gotten it wrong OR their sushi rice just did not have enough of the vinegar in the ratio. I was super disappointed to find that there were barely any salmon in the bowl. I barely even noticed there was fish in it. Although, I will say, they gave a good amount of seaweed salad in the bowl. Overall, the price was expensive for what they gave. Food wasn't terrible, just disappointed by the sushi rice and lack of salmon.
