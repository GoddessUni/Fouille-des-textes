I want to really like this spot, but reality bites and such is life. 

Not my first time here, I've been here several times in my lifetime and while the memories are good and people friendly, the food itself is ok.

The filling? Excellent. Why three stars? The bread. I just don't get it. The bread for most po-boys are so bad, they have that company made crust and crumbly texture that isn't too appealing. 

If you're looking for history, nice people, and a Nola experience, this is your spot. But if you're looking for a legit sandwich...I dunno, but it's not my spot.
