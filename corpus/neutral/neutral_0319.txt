Having recently moved to the area from NY, one of my main concerns was for the well being of my family. A close second however was the pizza. Being a lifelong New Yorker, it sounds cliche, but this came to mind, unironically, several times as we prepared to move.
Our first foray into the Philadelphia pizza scene was at Cosimo's.
They had several ready made pies of different types. I asked about their grandma pie and the young lady pointed to a thin looking Sicilian pie and said "yeah, grandma Sicilian."  My heart sank for I knew, that what I was looking at was not the grandma pizza that I've come to know and love (Shout out to Pizza Classica in Glendale Queens!).
None the less, we ordered our slices and headed home with the specter of a bad pizza experience looming over our shoulders.
The rundown;
Plain cheese slice - Pretty good. The sauce is a bit sweet which is fine by me, the cheese was good. The end crust had more bread like consistency and not the chewy, slightly puffy texture that I know and love.
Their 'Grandma' - My review is based on  the fact that they identify their pie as a grandma pie coupled with the other grandma pizza I've had in NY...I'm sorry, but it doesn't compare. There was no oily roasted garlic spread liberally atop the pie amid puddles of salty sauce with islands of fresh mozzarella cheese melted throughout.
Sausage slice - similar to plain, the sausage was good and plentiful.
If this turns out to be the best pizza in my area, I can live with that, however, my quest continues.
