While I love the food here, there is a female server who for some reason won't serve military members in uniform like she does her other customers. She will deliberately come and take things from the table, give them to other customers and not even ask if we were still using the items. When I was just in there recently my coworkers and I sat down for an hour, got checked on once and hadn't even received our food. While other customers who were there 20 min or less received their food shortly after they ordered and she checked on them constantly. I have gone in there out of uniform and the service is completely different. I will be requesting a different server every time or will be walking out from no


Update: The last couple of times I have been in there, I have not seen her so I'm assuming other customers had an issue with her too. The service has been MUCH better, and of course the food is still delicious.
