This restaurant has a good BBQ atmosphere to it, but it's sad the the food is not as good. I had the smoked sausage and burnt ends with a side of potato salad and Mac and cheese. The sausage was pretty good. I was actually very happy with it and their white sauce (forgot the name of it). The burnt ends were dry as hell. Seemed like they were just sitting out all day or they were smoked at too high of a temperature. I've had a lot of burnt ends in my life and they can be very juicy and flavorful. These fell short of the mark. The sides also fell short. The potato salad was unseasoned and the Mac and cheese was dry. I really wanted this place to be better, but the BBQ scene now is so good that it's hard to compete.
