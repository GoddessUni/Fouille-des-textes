I'm between a two and three star review on this place. The main thing bumping it up to a three was the service which was great. We came in around 5pm on a Sunday and there was no there. Still the service was great, the waitress was very responsive and helped out with everything. 

On the downside the floor was super sticky all over so that concerned me about the overall cleanliness of the place. 

The food was just decent. It was habachi and was ok but not great. My wife had sushi and didn't love it. I will say that the price was good. Definitely way cheaper than Jason toridatsu but I guess you get what you pay for. 

The habachi show was also on the lower end of the spectrum. I couldn't even understand what the guy was saying and they didn't do the thing where they throw the food in your mouth. 

All in all because of the price and service I think I would give this place another try. It wasn't awful just not great.
