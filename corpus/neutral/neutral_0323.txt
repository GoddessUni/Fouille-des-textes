I was surprised the Sonoran dog was so bad. Everything but the Sonoran dog was amazing, but that was the one thing I really wanted to experience as a visitor to Tucson. I just thought it wasn't that good but found out later mine was prepared wrong...no bacon, no grilled stuff, really soggy bun that fell apart after the second bite, not that special just a regular hot dog really. I know there wasn't confusion in ordering bc we had a conversation with the waitress about being out-of-towners and wanting to try them. I didn't even bother to finish it, I just ate the delicious carne asada tacos instead. I guess I didn't get to try a real Sonoran hot dog tho :(
