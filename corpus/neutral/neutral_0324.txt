I didn't need to come here this morning. My job hooks up a swank coffee discount so I really didn't need to come here. But it was a brand new coffeehouse, and McThrill gets drawn to those like a moth does to a lamppost. On top of that the name of the house is McThrill's drug of choice! So resist was something that I just couldn't do.

The place's grand opening is on Saturday. So they were pretty much open and working out the kinks before their big occasion. So it is too early to fully criticize. But it's a good thing that they're working out those kinks because they were definitely there. They had one of those counter prep systems where one person works the register, another does the food, and another preps the drinks. That usually works for places like Dunkin Donuts and Fourbucks (or even Bonte and Coffee Bar) because they usually have 5 or more people working the counter. But when you have 3 people working under that system it usually only succeeds in making everyone involved wait longer. And in the end it took them longer to get me a large coffee than just about, oh, every other indie coffeehouse in Philly that I've been to (If your keeping track on my list than that's a pretty big number).

But as far as product and quality Caffeination definitely has it. The Large coffee was the perfect wake up call that I needed in the morning. And I definitely noted the delicious looking pastries and variety of bagels. They also had an incredible assortment of drinks in the cold case. The menu also has an number of inexpensive sandwiches. So if they figure out a better counter system, or get a little more in the groove over the weeks to come, than Caffeination might just be on the road to some good things. Outlook = Good.
