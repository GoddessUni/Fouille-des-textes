I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised at our first visit to an O'Charley's.  Good quality food for a chain.

We arrived at 4:00 PM for an early dinner, the grandchildren were hungry.

We ordered an appetizer of chicken fingers.  our grandson enjoyed dipping them in a mixture of catsup and mustard.  Our grandson would not allow us to taste "his" Chicken.

We waited over 30 minutes for our entr√©es.    not sure why it took so long since the place was almost empty, probably a shift change!

I enjoyed the fried catfish, slaw, hush puppies and fries, my wife loved the sirloin and asparagus and our daughter-in-law enjoyed her usual Fish (Cod) and Chips!

We were full so we ordered 2 slices of chocolate silk pie and 1 of southern pecan.  All were reported to have been yummy.

Food good.  Service was slow, but I blame that on the kitchen since our waitress apologized several time.
