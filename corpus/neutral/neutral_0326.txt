The first time I went there I enjoyed it.  Nothing really outstanding about the food, but I did really like the buffalo cauliflower app.  However, I don't think that's usually on the menu.   The second time I went the service was slow and the food was wrong.  There wasn't any blue cheese on my black and blue salad. We were sitting right by the kitchen and I was done eating before I got the blue cheese.  The seats on the booth were broken down and one of us was in a hole and the others could feel the springs.  It wasn't enjoyable and I wasn't impressed.  I may give this location another try if someone I'm with insists on going, but with so many other choices, I probably won't choose it.  Sorry Scotty's but I like your downtown location better.
