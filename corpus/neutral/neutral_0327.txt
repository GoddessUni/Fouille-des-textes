So, this is a pretty cool building to have an establishment in. I like the atmosphere. It has enough potential to become something great with all its intertainment for bar goers. Sand Volleyball courts outdoor patio with other fun game to keep you having fun all night. It has some pretty good customer service. Supports local fireman and police services which is a great. The only thing I notice they are really lacking is flavor flavor flavor. Food selection is good but it all stems to flavor. It's just bland ol bar food. The three different times we have been there just to get a good flavored meal. It just always missed the mark. I will probably end up here again to get a meal sometime but it won't be my first choice to go get dinner until I convinced otherwise.
