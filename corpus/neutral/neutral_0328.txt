I would give this place 4 stars but for some of the menu misrepresentations.  For example:

Carpaccio di Manzo ~
Thinly sliced beef tenderloin, shaved parmigiano cheese and arugola.

The beef was not tenderloin.  My guess would be eye of round.  It was very tough.  The shaved parmigiano was cubed domestic provolone.  The "arugola" supposedly meaning arugula (rucola in Italian) was the ubiquitous spring mix.  Don't get me wrong.  The portion was huge and the salad was well dressed but I would rather pay extra for an appetizer portion of the real thing.

The bread and dipping oil were very nice and the lasagne and mushroom ravioli delicious.  

Service was good and prices reasonable, but please, do not try to deceive people with embellished menu descriptions.
