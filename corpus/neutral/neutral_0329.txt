We went to this place for date night last night. We were in Santa Barbara for a show and we found this place and it had great reviews and we wanted to try it. 

The service here was weird. We were seated and we started looking at the menu. We ordered drinks. Then decided to order dinner. My husband asked if he can change the sauce on the ravioli to meat sauce and the waiter said he has to charge him and we asked how much, he said he has to check with the chef. He goes and comes back and says $5 or $10. And my husband and I just looked at each other and he opted out. Not sure how he doesn't know what the cost of that would be. Didn't want to be surprised with a random amount on our bill. My husband ordered the ravioli and I ordered the ziti. There was no option for meat to go with our pasta. The food tasted good. 

Waiter barely checked in on us. We asked for more bread and olive oil and vinegar and he only brought back bread and was unpleasant about it. Then we asked for more oil and vinegar since we didn't get any and they brought us an overflowing tiny bowl. My husband asked for another beer that took forever to show up. We got dessert and it was ok. 

Again, the food is good. They actually had a lot of to go orders. But their service is really awful. Their prices are high for what you get. It is an okay place and I'm sure there are better places to eat at in Santa Barbara. People shouldn't be charged $10 for a different sauce. That is ridiculous.
