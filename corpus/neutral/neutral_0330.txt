I spent the weekend in Philly visiting some college friends. My first night's companion and her boyfriend took me to Monk's, which apparently has her favorite beer (I think it tastes like sweet and sour sauce poured into a perfectly good beer). All in all, Monk's was pretty good. It's supposedly a cafe, but don't go there for the cafe atmosphere. It's crowded, dark and noisy like a bar. If you're going to go, go for the beer. The selection is great and usually decently priced. I had a big pilsner glass of hefe weiss for about $6.50. The mussels there are supposed to be great but I found them to be just satisfying, nothing amazing. The same goes for the "pommes frites," or rather over salted french fries. The people I was with didn't help make the experience particularly memorable either. I wish you could review people on Yelp. 

This is really a bar that happens to have decent food. The word cafe is misleading. As a bar is near top notch, as anything else is just alright.
