long line at 3pm on a Sunday.  We waited about 15 minutes before making it to the counter.  The girl that helped us was very kind and very willing to help, so I definitely appreciated that.  There were a ton of flavors and we each tried 4.  I have to say though, the ice cream was not overly creamy, it was actually not as smooth as I was hoping or expecting.  My waffle cone broke, which is fine, I asked for a bowl, but my husband's had a stream of ice cream coming out of the bottom.  The waffle cone is really tasty, so I recommend it - but get a bowl alongside it so you don't make too much of a mess.

With the line and not the best consistency of homemade ice cream, I stand at 3 stars.
