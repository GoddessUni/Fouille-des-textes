Went for lunch and was underwhelmed. There was no band, just a loud radio. The service we exceptionally slow and when they brought our appetizer, they told us had we ordered from the happy hour menu it would have been $5 cheaper, we told the server that the happy hour option is what we ordered, she said "oh" set the plate down and walked away. The food we fine, nothing special, but like many other listed reviews; they were out of certain options. They have a good size menu and the restaurant is clean, but it's about like visiting a Bubba Gump or a Margaritaville. If you're in a hurry or are looking for authentic cuisine, your best bet is to pass.
