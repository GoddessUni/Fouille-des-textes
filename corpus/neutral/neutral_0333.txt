Not bad, not great, it's somewhere in between. We went early on a Sunday and it was very quiet. The interior is clean and pleasant. The service is about average. Some of the staff are very polite and others seem to be just going through the motions of providing customer service. To start, the spring rolls were very bland and tasteless. However, the Hoisin peanut sauce was good. The Hue Spicy Beef Noodle Soup was not very spicy at all. The broth was pretty good but not amazing. I think my biggest frustration with this dish was the beef flanks. These chunks of beef were very flavorless and unmemorable. The Dumpling Noodle soup was a little better but still nothing amazing. I really wanted to like this place better but in all honesty it was a bit of a disappointment. I will say that the Vietnamese Iced Coffee was outstanding. There is street parking and I think this restaurant has an arrangement with the comedy club Zanies which is across the street for discounted or free parking. Although the experience was satisfying enough, it was not good enough for me to go back. I had a better experience at Vui's in Berry Hill or Otaku Ramen in the Gulch.
