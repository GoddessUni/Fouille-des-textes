I have been here twice.  The first time with a large group.  The experience that time was bad.  Our server did not know the menu and while our table of 6 ordered both the spicy and southern chicken, he could not tell the difference between them when he delivered them to the table. The spicy chicken had marinara sauce on the side rather than the hot sauce. Obviously an error.  When we told the waiter he  informed us that it should be honey mustard,(wrong) disappeared for 10 minutes, sent a manager, another 5 minutes and then hot sauce, not honey mustard appeared.    The food however, when corrected, was delicious.  Decided to give the place another try as a party of 2.   Had an 8 PM reservation.  At 8:30, after several check-ins with the hostess team, we were still not seated.  All the while, the open table app still showed plenty of openings. We gave up and sat at the bar at 8:45 with not a single apology from the hostess.  The only saving grace? Jessica at the bar.  She got us drinks and our meals came out smoothly from there.   We were joined by several other "tables" who were never seated for their reservations.    I give up.  They have GOT to get their act together.   The food is delicous but waiting over an hour for it with a reservation?  Nope.
