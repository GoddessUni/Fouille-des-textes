Located in a rather expansive mall with an AMC, this Korean-Mexican fusion joint is Seoul Taco-lite for the lack of a better expression. Their offerings are more diverse, but they pack in less flavor--and fewer customers it seems. 

The good
1) clean space, friendly staff
2) the gochujang (bee bim bap sauce) was excellent and will go well with any of the offerings

The bad
1) kimchi pork belly burrito--it had hardly any kimchi or pork belly but mostly rice, cheese and lettuce. Everything was too bland
2) kimchi pork belly cheese fried--i had high hopes for these, but again hardly any kimchi and bland
3) the location--it's hard to get there and not much to do around other than the movie theater

I'd probably rather go to Seoul Taco. It's closer and more flavorful.
