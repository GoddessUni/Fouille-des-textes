We came in on a Sunday night for a quick meal before a concert downtown. We were looking for someplace on yelp and decided on this place since I saw it offered a veggie burger (as I'm vegetarian). We had a plans to each get a burger and split fries. 

First the good- 
-My veggie burger was delicious! Out of all the burger joints popping up, this is my second fave (behind Square One). 
-My boyfriend also really enjoyed his 1/2 lb burger. 
-The 'small' fries were actually a huge serving. 
-They offered beer and wine (my boyfriend partaked in a local brewed beer)
-The decor and atmosphere is very nice. There seemed to be a lot of seating (outside too) and we enjoyed the tv's showing the football game
-The employees were all very courteous
-Plenty of parking

The not so great-
-Pricey. With all these burger joints popping up, they're all pricey. I paid $29 (before tip) for said veggie burger, 1/2 lb burger, 1 small fry, 1 fountain drink and 1 can of beer. 
-Fries aren't vegetarian- I'm sure for all you meat lovers, you'll appreciate that they are fried in beef fat, but for me, it was quite a disappointment since we both wanted "burger & fries". My boyfriend couldn't even eat 1/2 of the fries though, so they had to go to waste. *On the flip side, I did appreciate the employees warning me about them not being vegetarian though! 
-They were out of bacon. Say what?! My boyfriend is a bacon fiend, this was quite a disappointment for him. He said he enjoyed his burger but it would've been much better with his beloved bacon
-The utensils in the self serve area only had knives and one lonely fork. We both needed forks since the burgers were messy. I was a martyr and let my boyfriend have the fork as he needed it more. So that area wasn't getting the love and attention it needed from employees
-Even though they have a number system (you walk up, place your order, they give you a number to take to your table), it didn't seem to work very well. Several times while we were there, employees were walking by with food asking everyone if it was theirs. System seems flawed. I think the issue is the 'to go' people don't have a stand to put their number in, so they aren't on display.
