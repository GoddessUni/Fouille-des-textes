Writing a review for this Milk Bar location since I have been going to the riverbend location more often than this one. It seems that this location gives you a little more meat on the bread but does not let the sandwiches stay in the oven long enough because many times I have seen sandwiches come out that the cheese has not melted all the way. That happened to me on the thai-chili lamb and when the cheese isnt all the way melted it ruins the whole sandwich. The southwest salad I got there was very tasty and loaded with ingredients. I would get the salads here but the sandwiches I think are better at the other location. For the record my favorite is the Shrimply the Best and that is coming from someone who has tried them all.
