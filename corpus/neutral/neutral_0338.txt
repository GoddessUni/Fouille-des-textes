I've had brunch at the Bungalow twice. On both occasions we were drawn in with a special offer. On our first visit we had a coupon for a complimentary cocktail with our meal and on the second occasion our Visa Signature card was running a special on extra points if we spent more than $50.  

The food on both of our visits was ok (not great, not bad). I preferred the French Toast Sliders from my first visit over the Eggs Benedict from my second visit. My sister ordered a salad on one of our visits and while it sounded awesome on the menu it didn't look that great in person. The ingredients weren't of the highest quality and the lettuce could have been fresher. 

The coffee was so terrible during our first visit (watery and burnt) that I didn't bother taking a second chance and ordered a mimosa instead.  There are several drink specials during brunch including a "build your own Bloody Mary bar".  My husband wasn't a fan of the Bloody Mary he built and said either he was a poor mixologist or he should have upgraded to a better vodka.

The service is always really friendly, but can be slow if you arrive during the middle of the brunch rush. (Not our server's fault, the restaurant was packed!) The ambience is really nice on the patio and there is usually live music on the weekends.  

The Bungalow is not my top pick for a meal, but I would return for drinks and appetizers.
