My interaction with Gamlin was brief and, I guess the word I'll go with, fine. We hit Gamlin at the end of the night looking to purchase some beers to go so we could continue hangs at our hotel. We came in around 12:45 in the morning, not knowing that bar time in the neighborhood was 1 AM. 

We let the bartender know we were just getting a six-pack to go, and I got the vibe she was not psyched to serve us. She let us know she had just restocked the fridge, but not in a friendly, "you've got your pick of beverages!" way, but rather the "are you seriously going to make a dent in my stock for tomorrow right now?" way. 

I get it. I do. But it was six bottles total and we would be leaving the bar after paying without any tab to settle or mess to clean up. In the end we did get what we came for, but I'm not super inclined to go back after being made known they'd rather not have our business.
