I came here for a brunch for my sister's graduation in October 2019. It seemed like I was immediately bombarded at the entrance of Golf & Social which was a little worrisome as it was raining outside and I was trying to gather myself. They did not inform my sister at her time of booking that there would be a cover charge of $10 so I was not prepared for that. Thankfully, my sister was and was able to lend me cash. While trying to get her attention for the cash, the bouncer repeated himself over and over "$10 cover" until I finally asked him to hold on a second so I could have my sister hand over the money. We stood around quite a bit when I finally came in but I think that was because we didn't have a confirmed group size just yet so not their fault. When we did sit, the waitress immediately gave us menus and about 10 minutes later she began taking drink orders. The "bottomless" mimosas were $25 pp, this is not including any food or extras. They did have a nice line up for mimosa flavors such as orange, cranberry, pineapple, etc. then we ordered our food and they handed us a stack of Uno cards to play which was a nice touch. Our food came out maybe 45 minutes later. I ordered the omelette and home fries (posted TOGETHER on the menu) and the omelette turned out to be pretty good. It was literally the size of my head or bigger so it served as my breakfast the next day. Before our 2 hrs were up, we were informed that they ran out of champagne and our endless mimosas were over. A while after we began paying for the meal. This is when I come to realize they'd charged me an extra FOUR dollars for home fries on top of the 11 I paid for the omelette. That was definitely a bit annoying to me but I went with it to not cause anything. There was hookah available if that's your thing. My sister had a good time. Our waitress was amazing. The music was realllly good. I would go back, I'm just going to make sure I eat beforehand lol.
