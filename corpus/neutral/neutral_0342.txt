Husband and I had guest in town from Maryland for a birthday celebration, we are not really familiar ourselves because we are here by military, so I went on yelp for help and reviews, we were impressed by the reviews so we made rsvp for 6 people, four of us arrived about 15 min before our other guest met us there. We were told could not be seated until your whole party arrives okay understand, mind you it's a Thursday night,  not really crowed, after waiting outside the door waitress said we will seat you now, we all looked confused because we where told we had to wait till everybody showed up, anyway I was glad to be seated, after seated our other guest arrived shortly. Loved how we were greeted once seat at the table, everyone order. long story short I had lamb chops my hubby had the big cow steak or something him and the birthday man order same thing and another had crab crakes and soup and crab bisque soup also, well I was asked how I like my lamb chops ( never been asked that before) so I say well done please to my waiter he said you do not like pink, I said no sir, my lamp chops came out pink, they had to take them back after getting them again they were still pink inside, waiter asked again how was they I said pink inside he said I'm sorry, my husband ate them because he doesn't mind pink, they had a very good taste I just prefer well done meat. My friend did not enjoy her crab cakes either but everyone was pleased. waiter could of offered me a credit or drink on the house or something. Just saying
