Maybe I shouldn't try every new Restaurant in town.  I do love to support local business.  However, my arteries are now floating in oil.  Now now, let me say Fried  Chicken and Waffles might have a place somewhere but not necessarily with me.  I bought a coupon on Groupon (which I love) and couldn't wait to see what people are talking about.  It's probably good for younger college kids because the place is loaded with lots of TV's showing sports events.  There certainly was a variety of folks there.  Lots of families with kids..  I was quite aware of many older folks enjoying the Restaurant.  I had the 3 pieces of fried chicken with 2 waffles.  Maple syrup was on the table as well as hot sauce.  Ostensibly to all be incorporated together. My hubby had the po' boy shrimp sandwich with french fries, which were close to tasting like cardboard.  My expectations for dinner were really dashed unfortunately.  I guess I'll stick to my ethnic tastes in food.  I'm always glad to try new and fresh.  With the Groupon it was a good deal though.
