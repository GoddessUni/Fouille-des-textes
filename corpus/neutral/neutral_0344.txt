For a place that prides itself on craft beers and burgers (based on their radio commercials, at least), I wasn't that impressed.  Don't get me wrong, the beer and burger I had were fine, but that's just it--I expected better than fine.  I went for dinner with friends and it seemed like a lot of their beers that were supposedly on tap either weren't available yet or they had run out.  Also, and this is my own taste, but I don't really care for pale ales, IPAs, and that sort of hoppy, bitter beer, and they seem to have a lot of that.  That made for slim pickin's in the non-hoppy beer spectrum.  I had the mozza turkey burger, and while it tasted good and there was nothing wrong with it, for $11 I expected to get a burger that was a bit bigger than your average fast-food type.  All in all, it's an ok place to grab a bite and a beer, but don't expect anything fancy.  I'll probably be back, but it'll most likely be on 2-4-1 burger night where I get more bang for my buck.

Protip: It's very busy on Monday trivia nights.  Get there early.
