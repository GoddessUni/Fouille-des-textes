I love this quaint little shop. When I could still eat gluten, the best cupcake by far was their Red Velvet Elvis cupcake.

Now that I am resigned to eating only GF foods, I was pleasantly surprised that I was able to find a GF option. While there was the only one, which is by far better than none, option available. Their GF chocolate cupcake was good. The cupcake it's self was very moist.  The frosting was ok. To me the cupcake to icing ratio was off. There was too much icing for the amount of cupcake and it was a little bit to sweet for the chocolate.

I was told that their 56th street location has over 10-15 GF varieties of cupcakes, and I will definitely have to check this out.
