On one hand, its the Bluebird Cafe.  You have to go.  But on the other hand, waiting outside for 3 hrs in the blistering heat is no joke.  We were first in line (though others came shortly after us) so we got the best seats in the house, but I was pretty annoyed that the first show is not even the headliner and you don't get to stay for the second one.  But then to get into the second one you have to arrive somewhere near the end of the 1st show line, but somehow time it right so that you're first in line for the second show.  I dont even know how its done.  

I don't know that I'd do it again, or even recommend anyone else to do it.  But it was a very Nashville experience.  Food was decent at best, drinks were meh, and band was good but not my fav I saw in Nashville.
