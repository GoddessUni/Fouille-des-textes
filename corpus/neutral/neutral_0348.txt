Fresh shucked oysters of different varieties set this restaurant apart. 3 of 4 had the oysters from their menu. All equally pleased. Although the service is friendly and the atmosphere relaxed, the service time was a bit too relaxed. Not to any fault of our server. By  my observation it seemed the kitchen was very slow to get food out. One of the cooks continuously kept burning food in a pan. The smell was offensive. The scallops were seared perfectly. Very tender and buttery sweet. The salmon had too much sear, basically burnt. Same experience for 2 in the group. Overall, would return and recommend trying. Next time I'm hoping for a more well rounded experience.
