Four lanes in each direction isn't enough. Maybe a toll will reduce traffic, but I doubt it. This is the most convenient bridge for many of us commuting between Hillsborough & Pinellas counties, at any price... As long as traffic is moving. 

Over the years, I've seen many dolphins & possibly sharks, while coasting on this bridge during rush hour. I prefer to drive in the far right lane for the views. Usually, all lanes seem to move at more or less a similar pace, so at least I get a better view from the far right side of the bridge. The downtown Tampa skyline never gets old!

Traffic flow is terrible. It's never been good. Never in my 30+ cognizant years crossing the Bay on this bridge. I still hope FLDOT will figure it out, someday.
