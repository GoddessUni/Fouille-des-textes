Not my cup of tea, there I said it.

While Mas Tacos claims to be the best thing in Nashville since country music, my experience didn't quite meet that expectation.

I loved the small room, the old jukebox, the Mexican pinball machine, and the chalkboard walls with the menu written on it.  I just didn't care for the food.  

$3 dollars certainly gets you a big taco, and two were enough to fill me up.  I ordered the pulled pork and the breakfast taco with scrambled eggs and chorizo. 

I like tacos to really pack a punch and I just didn't get that at all here.  The pulled pork, while plentiful, tasted a bit bland.  Maybe some smoke or a bit of extra seasoning would've helped.   I thought the breakfast taco fared much better, although, I wish they would add a bit more chorizo.  The scrambled eggs were creamy and really moist, a welcome change from the usual dried out powder variety. 

Maybe the addition of some house made sauce would do the trick, the Valentina sauce on the table doesn't cut it.

I don't think it's anything I would seek out again, but I would try it again at a festival.  Let's face it, the best Mexican is still on the south side of town.
