It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. When you wait a while to try a new place with so much hype, it aways seems to be somewhat of a let down. I'm not sure if expectations are too high or you are expecting someone else's great experience and that's hard to live up too. Our visit to Pinewood was so-so. There are some very good aspects to the place. The lighting, openness & rustic feel were defiantly positives. The bar is also a highlight with homemade syrups, hand carved ice, fancy glassware and classy cocktails. We also enjoyed the bowling theme throughout from painted white bowling trophies to bowling floor table tops. The booths looks comfortable and inviting with plush seating. Dinner was the biggest let down of the evening. The food seemed overpriced. The vegetarian dish was a joke and nothing else we tried really stood out. This probably isn't the best place for dinner and I am sure for drinks and games it would be better. I might try it again, but with so many other great options it will be a while.
