Came for lunch and sat on the dinning area. When we first walked in it had a very unpleasant smell. Almost like it had sat empty for a while and the didn't get cleaned well. It wasn't busy at all for being peak lunch time. We were the only ones in the dinning area so that was a good sign to me. I had two different sushi rolls. One was good and the other very plain. Also they were over priced compared to other sushi place. I don't think I will be back because Kona is right down the street and I liked their sushi better.
