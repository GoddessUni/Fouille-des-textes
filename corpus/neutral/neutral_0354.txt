So from the time we walked in until the time we finally got our drinks was 32 minutes. That's counting the 3 minutes the manager spent flirting with the hostess until we were finally acknowledged and another 5 minutes until we were finally sat. The drinks were spectacular and probably worth the wait. The food was pretty good too. The miso soup was one of the best I've had and the seafood plate was delicious except the one bad crab leg, which they replaced. I would have preferred the manager acknowledge it considering I had to spit it into my napkin and I probably would have gotten sick had I swallowed it. Personally I'm gonna blame the manager for this I felt like his lack of attention and overall ignorance set the tone for the lackluster staff and nearly ruined what would have been a great experience. I will give this place another chance because of the amazing food (oysters also some of the best) it's just a shame that this could have been an off the chart experience but bad management and a super slow staff almost killed it. It wasn't even busy. Food 4.5 stars service 1.5 for an average of 3...and that's being generous...
