Hmmm...it's not really a farmer's market and not quite a shopping center, but this place harkens back to the days of Southern open air flea markets.

Basically a collection of small-businesses that can't afford the overhead of a mall, you can do everything here from find cheap produce to look for second-hand clothes.

The highlight for me was the butcher shop - they have awesome meats, far better than the supermarket, and at very reasonable prices.  The ribeye steaks are especially good.

The clothing stores here, for me, leave a lot to be desired...they are not very trendy or well organized...they basically feel like thrift shops except not as cheap.

I wouldn't come here and spend the day, but if you've never been to a flea market-type atmosphere, this place would be worth a stop once or twice.  And I always stop in for some steaks when I'm grilling.
