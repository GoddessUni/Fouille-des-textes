After last night's Guster concert, I am bumping HOB up one star.

My reasons:
* Staff is really very friendly and fairly helpful. 
* After not being in the front row for maybe the first time ever there (because of volunteer duties), I can say this about the venue layout . . . there are a lot of places from which you can get a pretty great view of the action. We weren't anywhere near the front, and still really enjoyed the concert. Of course, it was Guster, so what's not to enjoy? :-) 
* I got to hang out with the band and crew after the show til 3am . . . okay, so that wasn't due solely to HOB, but it puts me in a good enough mood to bump them up a star. ;-) 

I still don't agree with the policy of "skip the line" restaurant receipts, but there are work-arounds, if you're clever. And they do get great acts, due to the size of the venue and being a Live Nation affiliate.
