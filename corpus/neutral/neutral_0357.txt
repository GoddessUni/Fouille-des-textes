Upbeat vibes and delicious food! Our first experience here was good and I will definitely be coming by again for more food. 

The biscuit sandwiches were definitely the items to get! I ordered the Chatfield and was very impressed. The fluffy biscuits had plenty of butter, and the piece of fried chicken in between was juicy and crispy without having too much breading! The apple butter added such a great tang and sweetness, and was a great compliment to the richness of the chicken and biscuits. 

The only true complaint I have is that I ordered a side of sausage gravy to go with my sandwich shortly after, but unfortunately never received it,  most likely because it had gotten extremely busy. The line had gotten very long and it was a bit difficult to talk to the staff behind the counter, so I was unable to resolve the issue. 

Despite that, the food was great and will be sure to try it again!
