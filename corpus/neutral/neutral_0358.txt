I love Persian food but once you've had the good stuff it's hard to not be critical. If I'm being tough on this place it may be due to the food I ordered, however, my take on restaurants is if the simple stuff isn't great, how are the more complicated dishes going to taste? I had beef koubideh and hummus, typical dishes found in Armenian, Persian, and Turkish cuisine. They were both okay but nothing to warrant the silly prices they were asking for the food. On the other hand, there aren't many places in the Philadelphia area that serve Persian food so hopefully next time I go I will have a better experience. Who knows, maybe their more complicated dishes will be better...
