Teavana a store with a great product and great things with salespeople that will make you not want to buy it. 

There is something about the used car salesman take on tea peddling that turns me off Teavana yet my love of their delicious product makes me push through and buy in spite of the sales people.

Teavana takes the sales idiom of ABC (always be closing) to new levels they never relent and will hound you until you exit the store with or without their product. 

The price is not the problem the pressure is. That being said Teavana's website offer all the same goods, same prices, and sometimes more selection then the store with a lot less pressure.

Teavana 5 star product 1 star service = 3 star review...
