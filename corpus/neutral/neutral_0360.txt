Beware that there are menu changes at The Gold Room at Westward Look.  The food is delicious and the views fantastic.
However the menu says a pot of coffee is $10.00.  What it doesn't tell you is that if you only have a cup of coffee it is still $10.00.
There was a pot of regular and a pot of decaf at our table of 8.  The three or four coffee  drinkers at our table were each charged $10.00 .

My advice, buy a $3.00 cup of coffee at the window when you enter the restaurant if you plan to have coffee.
