I've gone here to work for a while now and unfortunately the reasons to stop have been slowly building and today pushed it over the edge. 

Customer service is quite underwhelming about 90% of the time. Usually it's nothing crazy, just a general lack of attentiveness or feeling of caring at all from those taking your order. 

Bathrooms (can only speak for the male) are always gross. And increasingly not stocked with paper towels. 

Today I ordered an Americano and after what was at least a 20 min wait (the room was full of people waiting on drinks but order line wasn't long) I asked if my order was in the queue. 

It wasn't. 

They got another one going and had it to me in a couple minutes but didn't apologize or even acknowledge they had made a mistake. 

If this was a first time negative experience I wouldn't write anything my on here but this Starbucks has shown itself to be in need of some restructuring.
