Good gelato, confusing customer service.

Maybe because this place is family owned some of the younger staff in the evenings are not trained in how to talk with, or help customers.

Last time I was there, there was a line of about 20 people being held up by one couple trying every single flavor - twice. I don't know if these people were VIPs or buddies of the staff. But they didn't offer any samples to anyone else that I saw and this couple was there for at least 10 minutes, possibly much longer. They also had two staff, even if one staff member needed to catering to this couple's every whim, the other staff person did not make eye contact with customers, or say hello, or take orders as the line was building up.

I feel in the very least with a long line, you could greet customers right away, try to take other orders of people in line, or let them know what the heck is going on. Maybe this second staff was doing something very important that we could just could not see? There would not be a line if both staff were taking orders in a reasonable amount of time.

The gelato is good. It is worth waiting a few minutes in line.

But is it worth waiting in line an indeterminate amount of time, until the staff decide if, and when they want to take orders?
