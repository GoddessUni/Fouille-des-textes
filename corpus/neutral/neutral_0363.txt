I heard so much about this local spot and really wanted to like it. Unfortunately, I don't think I'd come back. There were way too many hiccups during our meal. The service was fine, but they didn't have anything we wanted. They ran out of pancakes! You heard right...a brunch place running out of pancake batter, at 11AM! That's inexcusable. I don't eat eggs so there wasn't much else for me to order. They didn't have waffles either, or the lamb sausage I'd heard so much about. So, my friend and I finally settled on the seafood party grits and I got a side of home fries. We didn't care much for the seafood grits. I ate all of the seafood out of them and pushed it to the side. The grits didn't have enough pizazz if you will. I don't really like grits unless they are heavily doctored and these weren't at all. Maybe it was just a fluke of a visit, but I was underwhelmed.
