As a lover of music, what I like about the Hard Rock Cafés, whether it be faux or not, is the rock n' roll memorabilia that line the walls within any HR is an experience in itself.
Philly is no different. Sure I've been at this HR location several times & yes, the service is hit & miss but mostly miss. More often than not, I'll surpass the dining experience & mosey up to the bar for a couple cocktails. 
If & when I do decide to dine, I hit up the burger side of the menu. Really hard to eff up a burger...but some how its always just barely above average. Aren't ALL HRs like this? I've never been "wow'd" by anything in a Hard Rock menu.
I've been to a lot of them & they're all pretty much the same...if you've never experienced a Hard Rock, try it. Some people hate it, some love it. Find out which side of the fence you reside on. 

3.5 stars for HR Philly.

Eat, drink & be merry. deez® out!
