So I was sort of expecting comfort food,  but better. How? I have no clue,  just "better" comfort food.  Sadly, I didn't really get that out of my meal. I tried both the mac and cheese and the grilled cheese with tomato soup. The mac & cheese, was alright, but not worth the price paid. It also had a slight... burnt taste to it. The grilled cheese was absolutely standard. Sort of what I used to make when I was 12. Again, tasty, but totally not worth the money paid. Same with the tomato soup, I would have been just as happy with some Campbell's. I think I'd much rather eat this type of food in the comfort of my own home for half the price.
