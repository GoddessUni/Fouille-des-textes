I love the Black Rock Bar and Grill in Brandon so I expected the same experience here.  That was my first mistake I guess.  I was only here because I'm of a birthday dinner.  I should of known when they seated us at table that was not wiped down it would be a foreshadowing of the type of service we would receive.

The host took us to our seats and sees that table has sauce or whatever on it says we'll wipe that up.  I'm thinking ok since looking around they were really busy.  Next we open our menus and the person celebrating their birthday their menu was just nasty every page had some type of substance on it, we inform the waitress she blows us off and states well just use the digital menu instead, um excuse you! You should want to clean that nasty menu not just put it on another table.  Asked for water never received it even we asked everytime the waitress came by the table.

The food was great as usual we started with the lobster dip which had great portions of lobster in it yum...I had the dynamic duo for my main course which I ordered my sides to be asparagus and mash potatoes never received the asparagus even though I kept asking for it along with the water I never received.  Notice the theme here the waitress just didn't care lol.  I still left a 20% tip because regardless of her lackluster performance the food service industry is still recovering from the pandemic.
