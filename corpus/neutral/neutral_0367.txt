My wife and I sort of stumbled across this place on our way to Greenfield. Part of me thinks we should have kept driving.
The beer was good, and the decor was pleasant (although be careful of the slick floors). That's worth a star. 
My wife ordered a club sandwich, and I ordered a blackened chicken sandwich with seasoned waffle fries. After a longer than normal wait and a second round of drinks, that's what we got, exactly what we ordered. That in itself is better than most new restaurants. That earns another star. 
The food was tasty, and the chicken sandwich actually had a little zip to it, so that earns a third star. However, that's where the star performance ends. 

There gave been some other reviews mentioning the slow service and the cold food. Unfortunately, our experience matched that. Our food was warm, but not what you would consider hot. The waffle fries were just a hair above room temperature.
When we finished (fries left half eaten), it took us forever to get our waitress to get our check. I saw three other tables get their bill, pay, and leave before our waitress even glanced our way.
We may come back here, but it won't be soon, and if we do, we will make sure the food is hot before we take a bite, or back it goes.
