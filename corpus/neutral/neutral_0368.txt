Why 3 Stars?

The place is new and a hot spot to try in the area. They are usually slammed but the facility is always clean and welcoming.

The food is ok but not up to par on this visit. I had some Grilled Boneless Wings that were under cooked. Glory sauce was nice. Appetizer pretzels were good and the nachos were HUGE!

Service is where I knock a star off as well. After telling ours about the undercooked issue, nothing was done. Drinks..not refilled...empty plates..still sitting on table. Second visit here and service was rough both times. They were not slammed with patrons at either visit, if they were I can understand a little drop off.

Great spot to watch a game and they offer some great specials for certain days.
