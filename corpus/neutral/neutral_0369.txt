I like Mangroves as a place to hang out, have a few drinks on the patio and listen to music with friends. Do I like to eat dinner here? NOPE!

I have come here a few times on weekend evenings. The decor here is really nice, I like the upscale, modern feel. There is a separate dance floor area upstairs, with some seating and an open dance floor. The music in here does get ridiculously loud at times, so for that reason I prefer to sit on the patio, where you can still hear the music and have a conversation with friends.

Like I said, as far as the food goes, I'm not a fan. I came here for dinner with a few friends, we had a groupon so decided to give it a try. The menu was extremely limited. Everything we ordered was a very small portion size, especially for the high prices. Nothing tasted like it should. The crab cakes that we ordered were way too much breading. The service was just okay.

Overall, I'd say this is a nice place to come for drinks, dancing and socializing, but eat somewhere else first before coming!
