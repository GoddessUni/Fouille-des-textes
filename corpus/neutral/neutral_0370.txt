Aah kolaches.  Mmm mmm, these little f*ckers are pretty tasty.  I enjoyed the ranchero, the sweetness of the bread was a nice complement to the salty spicy center. Extremely comforting and easy to eat. Perhaps the most perfect hangover food.

On the negative side, I wish they'd put a little more filling in these things.  Way to much bread for my liking.  I don't exactly get a high quality vibe from the ingredients, everything just seems kind of thrown together. I got one with sausage and it was just half a sausage link inside a piece of bread.  Meh.  The philly cheesesteak was pretty good.  Prices are slightly inflated, but not awful.  The whole vibe is kind of like a Dunkin Donuts.  

If you live less than 10 minutes away, I'd say this place is worth trying out, if only for the novelty.  If you brought a dozen of these to the office in lieu of bagels or donuts, people would probably like it.  But the quality isn't high enough to really keep coming back.  Maybe I'll pop in if I happen to drive by with a case of the munchies, but that's about it.
