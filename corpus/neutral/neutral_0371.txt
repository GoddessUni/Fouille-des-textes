This place was a bit disappointing, although maybe I was spoiled by having just been to Bern's.  The service was slow, and we were there pretty late so it wasn't like it was peak time.  The food took forever to come out.  The crab legs were only okay, although to be fair I did enjoy it when I had a piece of my mom's steak.  The lobster mac and cheese was the best part.  (That and the wine selection, which was extensive and had a great range of choices in terms of type and price point).

I might give it another try if I came to the area and stayed at the Doubletree, but I know you can do a lot better.
