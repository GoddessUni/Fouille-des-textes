I don't really divulge into the hot food trends, but I've always been intrigued by the whole smoothie bowl thing, so I decided to check out Sobol since it's not too far from my job. Walking in I can tell you that they manage the line flow pretty well, but it's easy to tell that the staff haven't exactly developed a cool head yet (read: easily flustered). 

As many have pointed out, it's pretty expensive. I got a kid's pitaya bowl sans coconut (they asked if it was by preference or allergy, which was impressive!) and it came out to $7. Now don't get me wrong, quality fruit like what I got in my bowl is hard to come by, but there's so much granola that it almost seems like they're cutting corners. 

This business is young, so I'll have to come back once they've landed on their feet.
