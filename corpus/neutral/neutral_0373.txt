This place is a good place to come to if you can rent out a private room for a large group! The first hour of karaoke is free if you order enough food or drinks to cover double the normal hourly rental price. 

I came here with a group of 12 and the private room was able to accommodate all of us. It is mega loud but it is a karaoke place, so what do you expect? Each private room has a button that you press to call in service, and they are really quick with catering to your needs. The karaoke machine was a bit hard to figure out at first but we got the hang of it, and it was a fun night. The food was ALRIGHT. I didn't like it too much but I was hungry so it satisfied me. I ordered mostly sushi which wasn't great but it wasn't bad. The skewers are alright..I was disappointed that one of the skewers were just mini hotdogs though. Drinks are a little on the pricier side but it is a karaoke place so you're bound to get overcharged for drinks. 

Overall, a good and fun place to come to enjoy a night of karaoking with friends!
