A bit pricey, $30 for a skillet, an omellete and a thermos of coffee. That's when I realized it must be a chain restaurant originating from a pricier zip code (they're from Atlanta). Zero charm or ambience. The potatoes weren't even toasted brown. The skillet had diced raw onions, which didn't really work for me.  When I asked to leave the bacon out of the skillet and substitute an extra egg, I got charged for the extra egg. The coffee was good, as was the service. For a big chain restaurant breakfast, try Le Peep in Belle Meade for better food, price and ambience. But I'd rather suggest Marche or Fido (or Noshville if you can get past the bad coffee). Note: there are no vegan choices save maybe pancakes, so unless you eat eggs, go elsewhere.
