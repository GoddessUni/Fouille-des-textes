Versalles is a cuban restaurant with somewhat of a unique atmosphere.  Many years ago this used to be La Teresita, a branch of the popular restaurant chain.   It later became Black Beans,  and now Versalles. 

Let me say the food is good.  The beans (black and red) are cooked cuban style, so for the Puerto Rican cuisine connoisseurs out there be advised the taste is different. The churrasco steak was well made, and the roasted pork was outstanding. The fried plantains were soft and sweet, and the flan dessert was delicious.  Foodwise I'd give it 4 stars. 

I'm knocking off one star because of the atmosphere.  I didn't particularly care for it.  There was nothing wrong, it was just a little strange. The chairs and tables are very elegant, and they have a stage where they apparently have some sort of live entertainment, although I've missed it the times I've been there. However, someone decided that purple light bulbs was a good idea, giving the place a strange look. There is also a pool table and several flat screen tvs (it does say bar and grill on the sign outside) in what looks like an attempt to create a sports bar atmosphere.  However, the attempt falls flat as it clashes with the rest of the more traditional decor. 

If that kind of thing doesnt bother you, you will be rewarded with a delicious meal. If you like cuban food you should give Versalles a try.   And if you like a more lively atmosphere with your meal, you may end up giving this place 1 or 2 more stars.
