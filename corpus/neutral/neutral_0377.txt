For the first time in last few years, a not so good experience at Flemings. My husband used to be a big proponent of rib eyes at Flemings - this last experience has him so disappointed he says he will never go back. Both my husband and son ordered a ribeye and both didn't enjoy it al all. The sides were great. Flemings potatoes and Brussel sprouts-both turned out great. My sea bass was pretty good. Drinks were great. Service seemed rushed as well. Not sure if this was due to the holiday rush but we sure didn't walk away raving as we usually do after a meal at Flemings.
