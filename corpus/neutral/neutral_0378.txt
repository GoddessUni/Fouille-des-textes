Trendy cute spot in Garden City. We started with a coffee and cappuccino..cappuccino must have been from a machine (like those in gas station).  Way too sweet. I had a yogurt with fruit and granola and a side of Avocado toast. The yogurt was sweetened vanilla with a citrus flavor. It would have been great if yogurt was plain unsweetened. Add that to my sweet coffee and it was way too much sugar. The Avocado toast had no seasoning and they weren't the best avocados & toast didnt hold up to the avocado. Now hubs had the Wild Harvest Omelet with tasty crispy home fries, eggs cooked correctly with feta, arugula, roasted garlic. He enjoyed it but we did not have a mimosa and the bill for 2 was 53$...too steep for breakfast.  New decor is fresh and service was great.. mimosa menu looks good but I am not a mimosa girl and not interested in spending that much for breakfast.
