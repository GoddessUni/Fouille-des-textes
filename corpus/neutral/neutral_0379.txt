I was excited to try SideBerns again. It had been at least a decade since I had eaten there. My initial impression was delight after tasting both the Hamichi Crudo and the Steak Tartare. Both starters were exquisitely presented and were equally tasty. The hamichi was buttery and rich; the tartare was superb! The two hot starters that I tried were equally yum. We had the roasted scallops and the Vadouvan squash soup. Each dish was excellent though the scallops may have been slightly overdone. After two great courses, I eagerly awaited our entree's delivery. What a disappointment!  The entrees, and I tried two, were just awful. I had the Seed and Nut  Crusted Snapper. Sounds delicious, right? Wrong! I ate very little and when asked if I wished for a to-go bag, promptly declined. The fish was overcooked and overpowered by the soggy brocollini and the shimeji mushrooms. Honestly, the combination was just off! I think I would have preferred creme brulee with bits of chicken breast added as garnish. Some foods don't pair well and this dish, with its heavy breading thrown in for added insult, should be erased from the menu and my memory. My husband's halibut was lackluster as well. Not as bad as my Seed Crusted Potluck but just not memorable. Would I give this restaurant a second chance? Probably not. SideBerns played with my emotions, promised me culinary magic, and just didn't deliver.  Reminds me of that great book that you can't wait to finish only to realize that the author lost interest somewhere in the middle.
