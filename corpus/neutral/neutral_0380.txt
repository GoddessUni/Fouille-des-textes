Ok.. where do I start. 
 I honestly did enjoy my Veggie soup, the price was even fair for the place and location... I think they did a great job considering it was a quiznos. The lights and colors are great.. .hence the 1 star 
 MY ISSUE HOWEVER, is that when i walked in, I looked at the menu and , just as anyone else would, asked some questions. They were all answered promptly, up until I asked if my soup had
 A. any stock other than vegetables.
B. any MSG.


That was the root of my issue with this place, the girl at the counter was a bit hesistant to tell me anything or the details about my soup so it seems like another girl that works there or maybe it was even her manager, but a pretty lady with radiant red hair (which is kind of rare to see on an asian woman) quickly butted in and said, and I quote "No, it doesnt have any MSG sir, and its made only with vegetables" 

So... Cool. I'll have it. 
Wow, this soup is full of flavor, i love  it!.
There's some kind of pork cracklin in it....ok, i'll spit it out, it's just one, must have been a mistake, Im not a baby about these things.


It had msg. Not cool. However, Im willing to give it another shot.
