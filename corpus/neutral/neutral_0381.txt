Came in for my husbands birthday.  We had made reservations for 5:30 on the "open table" app. Super easyWe arrived about 4:20 and the place already had 15 people at the bar. We were waiting for the rest of our group to arrive, so I decides to get a vodka soda with lime. The bartender had to come back and ask me if it was soda or tonic... Then brought it w a lemon... Not a lime.  The rest of out party arrived ( just two more )... We have a few flights of beer and a few appetizers. The duck confit sliders and the bone marrow.  Awesome awesome awesome!! We then head upstairs for dinner. The food was expensive for the quality. We had short ribs, scallops, halibut and flat iron steak. DONT GET THE SCALLOPS! they were brown on top but didn't have the crispy top w the warm center. Sent it back and they just warmed it back up and put it in another plate. The horseradish mashed potatoes... We lacking the horseradish.... And the citrus rosemary hash was missing the rosemary! Our server NIKKI ... Was awesome! God bless her little butt! She took my complaints and suggestions with a smile and w a positive attitude:) i would go back... Just for her! Anyway, she went out of her way to let me know that the manager went back to the kitchen to quality check our 3 concerns. Honestly, I don't know if i would go back for dinner... But HAPPY HOUR!! Im there. They have some YUMMI unusual appetizers that are worth the money!! I will be back for the bar.... Not so much for dinner!
