We traveled an hour based on Gilmore's reputation for French food & although we enjoyed a nice meal, it was not worth the trip. We won't be back - we can get same/better meals closer to home (in the suburbs). The food was good but not great: Rack of lamb & mushroom ravioli were flavorful; Escargot appetizer & lobster special ($39) were extremely rich which made consuming the entire serving too much of a good thing. 

The hostess situation was a bit odd. A woman came out from the dining area with her keys tucked in her neckline and her car fob hanging over the front. She would come and go from the foyer to the back room, and return asking (the same 6 patrons) if anyone new had arrived. This had no bearing on my rating of the restaurant but is noted for being strange. It would have been classier to remain there and greet guests for the short time prior to the seating.

The servers worked together well, especially given the confined space of the dining room. They were attentive and we wanted for nothing. 

Pro: BYOB 

Con: A single toilet for entire restaurant located at the kitchen door entrance and on top of diners. Lines for bathroom involved constantly moving aside for staff and standing over people while they ate. The restaurant needs to create/open upstairs bath to avoid awkward wait for patrons. 

Tip: Parking in West Chester can be a challenge. Reco using $5 Lot on Prescott Alley and walk through the lot between Post Office & Doc McGrogan's. That will bring you out a few steps away from Gilmore's front door.
