It's okay. The location is very convenient to a few neighborhoods and parking is easy (lot and street). As with many liquor stores in the city, the beer program isn't what you might hope for but I'm learning that craft beer is best left to the stores that specifically concentrate on it. Hoping for an all-in-one is akin to searching for the dodo bird.* And, to be fair, the name of the business references liquor & wine... not beer.

So, points for transparency... but points off for consistency. I have experienced the staff being incredibly helpful and chatty (such as when the clerk saw eye to eye with me for not wanting anything to do with having a wine named Pennywise in my house), polite but standoffish, *there*, and a bit rude (the response to my question and request for help? A blank stare and not one moved glute muscle from behind the counter). So, it's a mixed bag. Also mixed, the selection. There's a bunch of product but organization is not a strong suit. I suppose part of the point of a discount store (for anything) is rooting around until you find a gem. I get it. But, I favor browsing over rooting. 

I just don't know that it's for me. I tried.

*But there are some places who do it well. Check this space for reviews.
