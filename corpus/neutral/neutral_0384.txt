I'm conflicted about this place. I have an entirely different experience every time I visit. Tonight I stopped in after my workout to grab a quick bite and took my order to go.

I ordered a Southwestern bowl with brown rice. They do offer half off bowls during the week but I was about an hour too late to take advantage of it. Overall, it was a decent dish. However, the tortilla chips tasted stale, like they had been left out all day. It was pretty disappointing. 

In addition, they advertise free froyo with every meal. I was not in the mood for it and was already planning on turning it down, but I was shocked that it wasn't even offered to me this visit.

Overall, the environment is clean and inviting. And my meal always comes out quickly. But the experience seems to be hit or miss. The convienence of this location is probably the only reason I'd return.
