We went here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon. We had trouble finding parking but were able to be seated quickly. I was totally underwhelmed with the interior of the restaurant. It seems like the decorations haven't been updated in 20 years and it seems a little dirty in some places. I'm surprised that the interior is so drab because the food isn't cheap. I think the restaurant would do even better if they updated the interior. We liked the granola blueberry pancakes and wanderer skillet. I would return for the food, but it's best to come when it is not so busy. The tables were a bit crowded as well. The strip mall where the restaurant is located isn't nice either.
