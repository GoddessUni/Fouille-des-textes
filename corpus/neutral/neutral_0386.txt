Roasted: found this coffee shop in Goodlettsville TN and from first look - I knew I was going to love the look and feel of this place. Feels like you are walking into someone's house. Warm and friendly from the moment you walk in. Service couldn't have been friendlier. They use local beans roasted in Tennessee. Have a drive through window as well. Only one barista working which could impact speed but no one else was here when we arrived. They use an automatic espresso machine which pretty much ruins the espresso experience and you could taste it in the latte. Latte was overly sweet with the sugar free flavor but the milk quality was good. As much as I loved the ambiance and service - I wouldn't come back for the coffee. 

Unroasted: Small home converted to a coffee shop.   I feel it's a must just to experience that southern charm.   This place is great with plenty of seating.  The staff was very friendly and engaged our conversation.   Plenty of sugar free options but her barista abilities need some more training.   She did a decent and I have had much worst.   This place is still a must.   No sugar added
