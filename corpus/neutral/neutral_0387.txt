3.5 stars.  This restaurant has changed since my last visit.  They have new cafeteria type tables and a new menu.  New owner?  The menu still has a lot of the previous items, but now you have to pay  extra for the sides like $1 for sour cream.  This also means that they no longer bring you tortilla chips and salsas to the table at the beginning.  We asked for water, and they brought bottled water, which you have to pay for.  I guess they're trying to reduce their costs.  We had the beef tacos,  chicken enchiladas verdes (spicy!) and some chicken empanadas.  These came with a couple of sauces. The chicken tasted plain.  You have to add sauces to make it flavorful.  The beef tacos were good.  Not sure it's worth going back.  Will probably try similar restaurants first.
