The restaurant looked promising. It's small and just 4-5 families can fit, then you're sitting at the bar, which accommodates 3 people and a cash register.

The beef was very good, but that's the best part. The chicken on several items that I've been there is boiled and hard. Traditional Vietnamese food but much lower quality ingredients give it a loss of a star.

If you expect high quality foods, there's one on the south side of waters close to Dale Mabry. Same atmosphere but completely different food quality.

If you're wanting traditional Viet, Waters and Dale Mabry or West Waters by Wheeltec is better.
