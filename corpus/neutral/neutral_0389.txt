I've been to both this location and the Yummy House South so I feel like I have formed a full opinion of this establishment. 

First off I do want to mention that we had great service. With a party of 10, we got seated fairly quickly on a Sunday morning. The servers were very attentive and gave us everything we needed. 

In terms of food, however, I have to admit that the dim sum was pretty mediocre, especially for the price you are paying. I tried all of your classic dim sum dishes (har gao, siu mai, bbq pork bun, tripe, spare ribs, chicken feet, etc) and nothing really stood out. The siu mai was particularly mushy and didn't taste fresh. Some of the textures and seasoning of the other dishes were off. 

The one thing I did like was the Yang Chow fried rice. It was seasoned well, not too oily, and was packed with meat. I would consider stopping by again and grabbing that to go. 

Overall, definitely not the best dim sum place but it could serve as somewhere to satisfy your dim sum cravings.
