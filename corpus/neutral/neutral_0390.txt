Last night was my fourth dinner here, and as much I like this restaurant, I just can't give it more than three stars. We love the decor and the overall ambiance. I have no complaints with the service. I just think the food could be better. Our most recent dinner we tried a house specialty "gazpacho". It fell short of the description, which mentioned fresh tomatoes and corn as main ingredients. The tomatoes may have been fresh, but they tasted store bought - in other words, no flavor. I know that most dishes require salt to enhance the flavor, but this was so salty, I considered sending it back. My husband ordered the salmon, a dish I had ordered on a different evening, and he said it actually seemed to lack seasoning (unlike the gazpacho). I love salmon, and I remember that I was also unimpressed with this dish. Things I do like - the warm fresh bread, the wait staff, and the atmosphere. We just always leave a little disappointed with our menu selections.
