Just had my first smash burger experience. The customer service was wonderful. I had a pretty large to go order and they got everything right. Although they bagged everything separately and then put all of the small bags into one big bag which I thought was overkill. Vanilla shake was the best I've had recently. The burgers were good but, in my opinion, not great. The smash fries were delicious despite the fact that they were luke warm at best. The salad was decent. Overall for burgers I prefer five guys. Their burgers are meatier and more flavorful for the same price. I would still recommend giving this place a try.
