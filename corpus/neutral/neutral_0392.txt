We stopped in to grab lunch today because we were in a hurry and it wasn't too busy here.  Our server, Kyle, was very sweet and checked in on us every 5 minutes.  I had the endless soup and signature salad, which was a nice option since I was hungry and like to try a variety of items.  The smaller half portions were the perfect size too.  The french onion soup was decent but quite cheesy and they did run out of the chicken tortilla, which was disappointing.  The chicken caesar and shrimp and spinach salads were pretty good, though, and I liked the addition of sliced almonds to the shrimp salad, although the bacon was barely discernible.  The blackened shrimp was slightly greasy but pretty juicy and decent enough.  The black and blue burger was okay, with thick sliced of crispy bacon, blue cheese, and onions, although the fries needed some seasoning.  Our drinks were refilled consistently, which was a nice touch.  Overall, a solid lunch option.  It's a national semi-fast food chain so if you come with that expectation, it'll be a decent experience. 2 stars for the food and an additional for the service.
