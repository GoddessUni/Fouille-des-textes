Service was great but overall this place is overrated. I got the alligator tails after being sold to it by the hostess in line. Got half grilled and half fried and they were not good. The fried gator tails tasted fine but the grilled gator tails tasted so gamey and definitely not as good as $12.

The oysters were fine too but just OKAY.

This place sells itself as the #1 restaurant in New Orleans and that is absolutely false.

I'm just disappointed I paid so much here and was underwhelmed by the quality of the food.

Go to cochon or some place else instead for fried alligator.
