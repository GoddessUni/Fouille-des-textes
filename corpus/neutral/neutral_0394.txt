So I got take out from this restaurant over the weekend on my way home from work. First off, the staff is extremely nice, and very efficient especially for how busy they were the night I was there. I ordered the pulled pork combination meal that comes with fries and slaw, 1/2 pound of smoked sausage, and a side of corn bread pudding. The pulled pork was cooked just right and their BBQ sauce complemented it nicely. The corn bread pudding is very tasty, and reminded me of how my grandma used to make hers on Thanksgiving. The fries and smoked sausage were both good, but a little overcooked. You really could taste the smokiness in the sausage though. Overall good dinner from a nice establishment.
