Love you guys and wanna ask Moo Dang to make sure their serving sizes are regulated.  Also regulate what the spicy rating is.  I love Moo Dang!  Its the only place in Reno that actually has spicy!!!  Usually I order a 12/10 or a 7/5 spicy.  With Moo Dang I order a 3/5.  Unfortunately its risky cause it could be a 1/5 or a 5/5.  With portion size its also risky.  When I order inside, if I were to get it to go, it would barely fit in their to-go containers.  When you order it to go, the container is about 1/4-1/3 full.  Once I had it 1/2 full, as I would expect to normally get while dining in.  So-my ask to Moo Dang is to please provide better service in regards to your take out order.  

Edit.  Tried again and same thing.  Would have had almost double the food had I chose to dine in.  You guys are killing me...
