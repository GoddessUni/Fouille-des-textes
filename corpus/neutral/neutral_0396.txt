If you like BBQ restaurants, Sweet Lucy's should certainly be on your list.  It's not totally easy to get here so while it does draw people from all over, it is very popular with people from the Northeast.  I've been there twice and found everything okay but nothing totally exciting either.  The meat and ribs were fine - not the best ever but tasty enough.  The sides were hit and miss.  The Monday buffet is a trip with people crowding in to Sweet Lucy's to take advantage of this all-you-can-eat offer. There is a lot of food to choose from ... but first make sure you have space at a table to actually sit down and eat. Nothing overwhelmed me here except for the huge quantity of food. Welcome to America!
