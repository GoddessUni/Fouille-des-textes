3 stars because the food is great! But the service is so bad. They're definitely nice people but just totally spacey and not on top of the service side of the business. Very slow. Also we ordered a cup of soup and salad as an appetizer and all the sudden our entrees come out. We said great, but we ordered starters. And they said oh we are out of the soup. Well.... someone could have come over to let us know. Really??? Maybe if we just ignore them they'll forget about it. Ends up the kitchen had it all plated and waiting for us, but they're so spacey it just never got to us.
