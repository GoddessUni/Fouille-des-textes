Man...I hate to be "that guy" who either doesn't get it or just isn't cool enough to dig it.  But, I don't get it and I don't dig it.  I don't frequent this place but i walk by every day on my way to work.  It's like a homeless shelter outside...  And none of these Hipster Doofus' are even drinking coffee.  It's like walking into the den of iniquity. 

The few times that I have been there, the service is either great or just plain sucks.  On one occasion I ordered a drink and a "regular" who ordered 2 people after me was served first.  I thought to myself WTF?  I even asked her about it and she mumbled something about knowing the guy...

The thing that will save Dawson's for me is that I HATE retail chains including Star Sucks etc... and I ALWAYS buy local if I can.  So, as much as I bitch about this place I will probably buy coffee there every now and again.

The atmosphere is actually pretty good and the Hipsters begin to leave as soon as the soup kitchen opens at 9AM, so outside seating becomes available.....
