The style is Americanized Vietnamese food. My family and I started with the tuna ceviche. It was good, not great, and a very small serving in a martini glass. We also started with the Fried shiitake mushrooms which was a crowd favorite! We all enjoyed them. I had the curry chicken which was served in a hot bowl with chicken wings, potatoes and vegetables and a side of not so great bread. The dish was good, with hot juicy chicken falling off the bone. My husband had the Pho with chicken which was very basic and not very flavorful compared to true Vietnamese restaurants. The waiter was really nice and friendly. He helped answer questions about the menu and suggested some dishes. The restaurant seems to be owned a really nice family. But overall, their small dishes, expensive prices, and no fantastic flavors left me feeling underwhelmed.
