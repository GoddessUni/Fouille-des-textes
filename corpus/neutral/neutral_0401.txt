I'm not from the area, but visited Smokin Betty's for a friends birthday brunch. The atmosphere in there is pretty laid back, while still having a good look and vibe for celebrations and dates. There were so many things that looked amazing on the menu, but Seth (the greatest and most entertaining server I've ever experienced) helped me choose the Smoked Salmon and Sweet Potato Hash. Three of us (two women, one guy) choose this for our meal. We all agreed that the flavor was great and the salmon was cooked almost perfectly. The potatoes were well seasoned, with herbs, onions, and bacon throughout. On top was an egg over easy, which was cooked longer than I like (me likes runny yokes!). The three of us agreed that the portion wasn't quite enough, and I ended up ordering another egg and eating off other people's plates. One person ordered the mac and cheese and claimed it was horrible, but a few of us tried it and felt it was just very bland. I tried a bite of the breakfast burrito, and really like that as well as the cottage fries. We ordered pitchers of the white sangria. I'm more of a red sangria girl (which they don't have), but it was light, fruity and slightly fizzy and enjoyed by the table. I finished brunch with the bread pudding (flavor changes daily) which happened to be a wildberry cheesecake with a caramel sauce. It was very moist, a good thing with this dessert, and had lots of berries and cheesecake bits in it. As a self-proclaimed bread pudding connoisseur, I'm more partial to a more classic bread pudding with a bourbon or liqueur sauce, however the caramel sauce added a nice touch (I'd recommend asking for extra though), and the portion was enough for sharing. I'd be curious to try some of the lunch/dinner options as they had a lot that piqued my interest, but I probably won't be going back, simply because I live a couple hours away.
