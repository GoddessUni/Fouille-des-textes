Dive dive dive bar.....Did I mention it was a Dive bar? 

OK now that has been said went here after recommends on another travel site as we were looking for crawfish boil - it lived up to that  promise.  Went 2x in fact.  

Saturday night at Midnight for the 1st time - very informal - you pay at the bar ($16 I think) they give you a to go container (one of those white styrofoam ones) and you scoop as much as you can into it - we choose mainly the mud bugs, but they had potatoes, corn and sausage in the boil as well.

It was pretty spicy the 1st night.  2nd time (Monday at 6pm) it was less spicy.  

Beer was cold.  Waitstaff was nice. decent music on.
