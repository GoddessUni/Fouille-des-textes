I used to work across the street from this property back during high school and college and there has always been a miltitude of pizza stores that would be open for a year or two, someone new would move in, rinse and repeat.  It's nice to see a break in this cycle with something different.  There are only 2 tables inside so take out is definately the preferred method here.

The food was just alright and reasonably priced.  You can the tell the staff enjoys what they do which is serve tasty homemade dishes.  While there wasn't any wow factor to it, I still want to go back to try other items.

The Mexican chicken just tasted boiled, and the quesadilla was as plain as you can get.  However, the highlight of the meal was the pastor.  I tried it on a torte but will definately be back for tacos (their Facebook is up to date and specials are listed where pastor pops up from time to time)  

3 stars because the food wasn't bad but wasn't anything special.  I want to go back for more pastor and to try their bistec so I will definately be updating my review with my next visit.
