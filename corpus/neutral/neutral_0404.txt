They restaurant is doing a good job at keeping customers save with the distance in between tables, masks being provided upon entrance and hand sanitizer. The menu is available through a QR code. Brownie points for that!

Wait staff was average, and so was the food. I had the chargrilled oysters, which came out quickly and HOT. They were good, but not the best in the city. 

The chicken sandwich was just okay. The chicken was a bit tough and I wondered why it was so thin. It was a bit dried out. The toppings were fresh though. There condiments aren't on the table, and you have to ask flour it separately. As a safety measure, they bring it in small condiment dipping cups. The best part of the meal was the sweet potato fries! Those were excellent!
