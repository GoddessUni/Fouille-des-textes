We periodically order from slice because it's close to our house. The pizza is really good. I usually get a little "healthy slice" pizza which has cheese, artichoke hearts, spinach, chicken and tomatoes. My boyfriend usually gets chicken wings and a pepperoni pizza. I've tried some of their other menu items (spaghetti, chicken fingers, Cesar salad) but it's nothing special. The pizza however is always really good. I find the restaurant's atmosphere a bit off. It's always really dead in there as most people get takeout. We sat down to eat there once and it was just not a very warm dining atmosphere. Having said that, the staff are all nice enough so I wish I could give them 3 and a half stars.
