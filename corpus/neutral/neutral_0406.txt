Bangkok is A-OK in my book. And while I've never been to Thailand I have eaten at some well
Respected Thai eateries across the country. Our little Bangkok cafe churns out your typical fare at higher prices than more folks would like. I'm a fan of the green curry and the yellow curry. I prefer my curry with beef for pork. For apps, we ordered the spring rolls with tofu, which I personally don't love. We also ordered the grilled pork served with sticky rice and some sort of garlicky-fish sauce that was quite tasty! I'd order that one again. I enjoy Thai food and I'm always curious about the other Thai joints in town. But when I'm craving a curry dish I know it's a safe bet with the green or yellow curry.
