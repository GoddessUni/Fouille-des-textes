Have been here a few times and have found it to be adequate. The service is standard, nothing above average, we did have to wait for a glass of water while our waitress put out silverware on empty tables. 
The glass of red sangria I had was quite good, the bright spot of our meal.
We started with the classic bruschetta. If you aren't a big fan of balsamic vinegar, beat if you don't get this. The amount of balsamic they used completely overpowered everything else. We would have liked to taste the tomatoes and seasoning but that was not to be.
I had fettuccine alfredo, sauce was loose and not too flavorful. The pasta was very al dente in spots and quite over cooked in others. Not impressed at all.
If you're looking for anything other than a brick oven pizza, there are much better Italian restaurants in the area. I personally would recommend Tarantella's, excellent service and delicious food. Makes Bertuccis look like an Italian wannabe.
