Sugarfire misfires on the layout of the land.

Yigh- yigh- yigh what a poorly planned restaurant layout. When you have to put up a sign with an arrow saying "this way" and the sign leaves you just as confused , you have issues. One of our diners actually went into O'Fallon's next door due to this "sigh"nage. 

Once you figure that all out, you get in line to read the billboard menu. This is like cafeteria style. You get a brown paper wrapped tray. They throw your meat on it and pass it down to the next guy who serves up the sides. They do have a creative list of sides I must say. I chose the Mac-n-Cheese. The problem is the side dishes are served in flimsy paper containers. My husband had the BBQ Beans and the beans sauce was running all down the container. 

You then move on to the cashier area where you can help yourself to pickles spears, peppers, sliced white bread, and onions. Pay for your food and proceed to help yourself to the drink station. 

Bare with me, my reviews are usually a combination of food, service, and atmosphere. Many people may find this whole set up *YeeHaa" but I am a fan of table service. I don't mind ordering at the counter, but at least bring the food out to the table. 

 I had the ribs and they were very good.The Mac n' Cheese was rather bland, the big shell noodles bordered on mushy. I tried my husbands beans and they were great. I also tried his pulled pork, it was very moist and tender.

Sugarfire seems to be doing a thriving business so maybe I don't know jack_ _ _ _ 
what I am talking about. This is just a review from the world Iive in. I gotta cut this short, I'm late for therapy...
