I like the cocktails and ambience in the restaurant, but thought food was not nearly as good as other Cunningham restaurants. The concept is southern style, bbq cuisine. The menu has exciting options, but they do not manifest well on the palate. Portions were small for the price, and flavor/quality was not what I have grown to expect out of Cunningham restaurants. The highlight other than the drinks was the fries. The fries were very good, with awesome sauces. Otherwise, unimpressed foodwise. Recommend if getting drinks and snacks, while watching a game at the bar. Do not come for the food.
