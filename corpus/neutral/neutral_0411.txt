Food was good but the tables are too close together for me. I could hear my neighbors better than I could hear my friends... and the server kept rubbing his junk against my arm on his way by- either by accident due to the closeness of the tables [benefit of the doubt] or on purpose because he was a creep... also recommended a $95 bottle of wine without stating price which we got and were shocked with when the bill came. Was uncomfortable. Will not be back. Food was ok, but not worth the discomfort. Not normally in it for the negative-ish review.. but this one had to happen.
