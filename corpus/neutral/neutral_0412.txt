The chicken pasta was great. Not extremely "saucey" mostly chicken, pasta, veggies and tossed in olive oil and seasonings (not a white sauce or anything heavy).
The pizza was pretty good as well. The spinach dip wasn't great, it didn't seem like very much effort or creativity is put into it  (lots of spinach, not much sauce, not extremely flavourful) 
There was only one waitress and she wasn't quick, but she was polite and attentive enough for us to get drink refills, take home boxes and our check in a timely manner. It wasn't bad but it didn't really leave me wanting more. 
Also, our ticket was about $60 and they took it upon themselves to add $10 gratuity to the check  (it was our family of six, two adults and four children under 10, but they're well behaved and didn't leave a mess so I assume I missed a sign somewhere stating that gratuity is applied at Managers discretion or for parties of 5 or more)  we would've left a generous tip (more than $10 for sure) so it was slightly insulting to be charged gratuity, but, nonetheless we left her an extra $10 (plus the gratuity) because she was pleasant and it was a slow night so we figured she may not make much else.
