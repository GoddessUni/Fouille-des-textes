I go to the Herbiary store at the Reading Terminal Market in Philadelphia.Not too helpful and friendly as far as the staff. They seem to be useless for that! You will think going there to look at the many herbs and spices and to learn about them and get information will be the thing. I was there about 3 times and the staff there, usually about 3 women will greet you in a warm," hello", or how are you? Or Welcome to Herbiary let me know if you need any help. You do not get that! It seems they are just there to keep the items neatly in place on the shelves or make sure none steals anything. Not to say that is bad but they could be  friendly and smile not look depressed or disgruntle or have that," I do not want to be bothered" look. It is sad for an herb store staff to have an demeanor like this. It makes me not want to go there anymore and buy my herbs somewhere else. It is good to buy in person from a herb store to get a first hand in hoe they look, smell and get information about everything. I research some essential oils and ingredients to use to make homemade toothpaste before going there. I'm glad I did be cause the girl there seems to not really answer any questions or have a long conversation about what I was saying. You cannot have a store like that and you do not seem to want to converse with the public. I hope those women at Herbiary do not have 'SELECTIVE" in whom they want to speak. That will be totally wrong!
