Went there last night before Christmas in the Oaks. I was excited. The place looked pretty cool from the street and this kind of hole in the wall NOLA restaurant has become something I look for, to hell with Chili's when you live in a place like this.

That being said, I was seated quickly outside, the table was dirty, but not the end of the world. I order some bread sticks (which I thought was awesome) Ordered Chicken Parm (which was good, but really unimpressive) Slice of Cheese Pizza (plenty of cheese BONUS!!)

So food was good, nothing spectacular, nothing gross. Service was okay. Having dogs in a dining room setting (even if it is outside) loses points with me. Some of the clientel seemed kind of shady.
