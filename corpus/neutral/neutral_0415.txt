Was back in Jersey visiting some family, and needed a place to watch some football. Decided on PJs since it was easy to get to, and we were feeling lazy. It's a sports bar, it's fine, but it's nothing spectacular.

Food - ended up with some wings (which were okay), loaded tator tots (which were delicious... but a smaller portion than we expected), and some burgers (which I didn't taste, but seemed fine by those who ate them). Beer selection is decent - it was nice to see a decent selection of beers of draft! 

Atmosphere - nice and open, lots of TVs, good place to hang out and watch the game.

Service - terrible. Seriously. Not rude or anything, just... fairly non-existent. I mean, seriously... I think our group would have spent a ton more money if we had ever seen our waitress. There really weren't that many people in the bar... and we still barely saw our waitress. It was almost as if she was actively avoiding our table..

In conclusion - you're in Cherry Hill. Your options are limited. It's a perfectly fine place to meet up with some friends for some bar food and beers. Just don't go when you're super hungry. Or thirsty. Or in a rush.
