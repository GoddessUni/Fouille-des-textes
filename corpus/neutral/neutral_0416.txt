Tuesday is cheap steak night at Marco's, which both of my companions enjoyed. 6 oz filet (for only $11) was cooked to the requested temperature and baked potato was fresh. I opted for the spaghetti with Italian sausage. My pasta was overcooked but the flavor of the sauce was good, if a little thin. The sausage was overcooked too, or maybe just a tad too long in the warmer before it got to me. All dinners came with a nondescript salad but the bread was fresh, warm and crusty, very nice. We split the caramel whiskey bundt cake, which was a moist yet light and springy spiced sponge with caramel drizzle and whipped cream. Quite tasty. Our server, Chad, was lovely. He teased the older ladies at our table to their great delight and provided excellent service. As the crowd grew, the place got very loud and a bit stifling. Tables are pretty close together and apparently cheap steak draws a crowd, so we had to ask folks to shift chairs to get out of our table. Overall a solid meal with great service. I give it a 3 because nothing wowed but it is definitely solid. I'd go back, maybe try the steak!
