I must say that first the total concept of this restaurant is amazing. I love that people are now given healthier options at restaurants so they don't feel as guilty after. You're not just getting a piece of grilled chicken and broccoli here you are getting so many more options than that. When I went with my two girlfriends we all had high expectations, but the one did warn us that she received some bad service before. We went in without a reservation and were seated at the high top tables by the far. We have all previously served in restaurants so we are very patient and understanding but I must say it is unacceptable to wait 15 minutes for someone to come up and greet your table. We actually had to go up to the hostess stand twice throughout the night once to get our orders taken and the next time to get the check, which was just disappointing. 
After we finally got our drinks we ended up splitting a variety of appetizers including the meat plate, tuna, and a flat bread, all which very very tasty and light. We all enjoyed the food and I can say that I would return for that reason only but I would be willing to give the service another chance.
