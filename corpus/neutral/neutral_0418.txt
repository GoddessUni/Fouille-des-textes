i have seen a lot of reviews about this place. but i wanted to see it myself.
saw this review on the avenue couple months ago about the chicken on the brick
or brick on the chicken? looked like a good dish.

now, its dark from outside. you don't even know if they're open or not.
as soon as you enter its classy looking. reminded me of century grill
sort of but the lighting wasn't as dark. the open kitchen is a great concept.
i loved it. the exit door from inside looks weird though......

my wife and i ordered the caprese salad, the pesto pasta with scallop, and
after a long debate, went with the lamb chops instead of the chicken. i mean
i've been craving lamb for the longest time.

the caprese salad was real refreshing. varieties of tomatoes, fresh
mozzarella and a little bit of pesto. bam! nailed it. it was a big dish so we
picked on it throughout the meal. 

the pasta. i haven't had a great pasta in edmonton yet. and after the visit
here, still...... i haven't had a great pasta yet.  a little salty to me and the 
scallop were grilled and just on it. i didn't feel like it was a part of the dish.
it was good but i wouldn't have it again.

the lamb chops. we asked for medium. we didn't get it that way. 2 out of 5 were
but the rest were medium well so that's a shame. its a big deal to me actually. 
because i love lamb and also  especially because the dish with the rosemary 
potatoes added up to $57! 

we couldn't go for dessert cause it was a lot of food. but their dessert menu
seemed a little weak. 

service was attentive. excessive to me. i'm a person who go to restaurants
to enjoy my food, not to build a relationship with my server. paying me almost
10 visits on a three meal course is a bit too much....especially when the chef
himself delivers the food to me.

so the total was $115 and we had no wine so slightly above the rest of the
restaurants.but since their menu is interesting, i would go for another visit.
