I like Caribbean food and having been a Scuba Instructor on many of the islands I have been lucky to have eaten some of the best.

The food here is good, not the best but a very good representation, along with the Grace ginger beer which is a must.  Food is fresh and you have to wait as they cook to order.

The problem is cost, for a dinner for 2 with soft drinks and coffee it is over 50.00.  This may not be much for a dinner out, but for Caribbean I can get the same dinner in many other cities for much less. 

Go and enjoy, but if you are familiar with the cuisine you will not feel you get value for your money.
