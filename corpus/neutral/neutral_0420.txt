Good food and nice atmosphere, but the service is so bad we'll be reluctant to go again. We live nearby and were happy to see the restaurant open, but we've been here twice and spent a total of almost  six hours waiting for dinner.
On our first visit they were fairly busy, so the delay may have been understandable, but on the other the waitress spent most of her time talking with friends at the bar.  We had to wait for menus, wait about 20 more minutes to put in our orders, another half hour for food, then the waitress vanished for about 45 minutes, until after  our meals were finished.  We had to ask twice for our check, and when it arrived, we were charged $18 for desserts that were supposed to be free as part of a promotional deal. We've heard similar complaints from neighbors.
I'd really like to see this place get better, because there isn't a decent restaurant in the neighborhood, but the service is a serious issue now.
