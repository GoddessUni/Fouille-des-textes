As a local, I don't venture to Broadway often but a friend was performing so I ventured out into the fray. I've been to Acme a few times in the past and have had mixed experiences. 
Being a Wednesday night, it wasn't crowded at all. Even with no masks in site, I felt fine. I've never ordered food here but the drinks are on par with the other businesses in the area. $11 for a basic cocktail and upwards for their specialty drinks. 
My issues with Acme are always with the service. Tried to order my friend and I a bourbon and coke but was offered Jack instead. I didn't bother to actually look at the bottles behind the the bar and thought that they were out and just agreed. No biggie but right before I was leaving my friend spied Bulleit Bourbon behind the bar. Not a big deal but why. Otherwise, it was a pleasant experience.
Would I choose this place to hang out regularly ... no but for an event to support a friend ... sure.
