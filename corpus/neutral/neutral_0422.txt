Solid bar spot.

Stuff mushrooms were overly fried, where it almost hurt to chew on them.  "Lightly breaded" my ass.  I had the smoked shrimp enchilladas, which were quite tasty, and the wife got... some chicken and mushroom pasta with a creamy sauce.  

Oh right, it was labeled as some "wild mushroom pasta."  I think for those of you out there who serve dishes that prominently says "mushroom" should know my theory.  If someone orders such a dish?  It is quite likely that they are big fans of mushrooms.  Don't even bother with much of any protein.  Freaking pile on the mushrooms.  Would it be cheaper?  I dunno, but it would definitely sit in one's mind more.  I actually remember it more as a chicken pasta dish that just happened to have mushrooms.  Definitely not as impressive.

This place seems like a solid place for happy hour, but I'm not driving a half hour for this place.
