Neighborhood bars are always the best places to visit! Nadine's is a Soulard spot which I am glad I have been exposed to. While visiting during a week night might be a good idea, I typically visit on weekends. The crowd is never too crazy and even on a Saturday night I was able to find a spot. 
The service was good and the drinks were fine. Ordering a bucket of beer is the way to go! While sitting and enjoying the conversation it was also fun to watch a group of guys play darts! 
The only down-side to Nadine's is that smoking is allowed, but I'll admit it wasn't too smoky when I was there. 
I'll definitely be back.
