Okay, so I don't watch Top Chef and didn't have any expectations about this restaurant before dining. It appears that some of these reviews are biased upwards just because they ate at a top chef restaurant. I couldn't care less about that as I only care about the taste. Overall, I have had better. Hate to be the downer with the 3 star review, but reading these reviews below seem over-hyped. 

Total dishes tried included the Scallop (singular), Albacore tuna, mackerel, gnocchi, Niman ranch beef and the walu fish, the chocolate pudding and citrus curd dessert. 

The Albacore tuna dish was exceptional. It was raw, had bits of crusty stuff and horseradish sauce making it a fantastic combination of texture and flavor. The Gnocchi was outstanding as well. It tasted like a dish of cheese with bacon pieces.  Other than that, the rest of the food was just okay. The mackerel was very plain tasting and I think that the Farm and the Fisherman restaurant does it better.

I didn't like the beef so much that I switched with my GF. The flavor was so off (apparently the mushrooms that were cooked with it) and the meat was so fatty that it didn't appeal to me. The Walu fish was a step up, but I wouldn't order it again. The nice part about it was the pine nuts that really added to the flavor. It was a little heavier than most fish, but there was something on the plate that threw the flavor off. It was covered in this foam which I've never seen before, and it reminded me of a rabid dog.

The interior is very small with maybe 8 tables. 
Service was good and waitress was nice. 

Total dinner bill was $144 before tip for 4 courses and no alcohol. Not a bargain, FYI.
