Our experience was frustrating and it may have been due to the COVID restrictions. I do appreciate Barbacoa working hard to remain open. However, the point of a reservation is to secure a time and seating area. I had called a week in advance for a reservation for my best friends birthday, the person I spoke with took down my info and said everything was set. I asked what their policy was for adding additional seating and decorations. The staff member said that I could call ahead to add seating and that decorations were okay. I thought she was nice and helpful because she offered the staff would be able to decorate the table if we wanted. 

The day of the birthday dinner reservation I called a few hours before to make sure balloons were allowed, the staff member said it was allowed. I asked if it would be okay to seat most of the party at the reservation time in order to surprise the birthday gal, the staff member said yes! The reservation time came and went but our party waited almost 30 minutes to be seated. The balloons that we had brought were questioned and discouraged. 

The entree and drinks were delicious although it took two round of appetizers to arrive. Our server was very nice and by the end of the night we had a great time. 

I do think that because of its reputation, I held Barbacoa to a higher standard. It was completely disappointing to experience so much frustration from their lack of communication as well as knowledge of their own policy.
