My husband and I were visiting Santa Barbara for our baby moon and had great meals the whole time we were here and decided to try Dawn Patrol for the great reviews. The ambience is super cool and chill and the menu looked good. I got the patrol combo, scrambled eggs with sausage and added a pancake while my husband got the breakfast burrito. The food was ok, my scrambled eggs were more like an omelette with no flavor, sausage had no flavor either and the garlic potatoes tasted a day old. The only good thing for me was the pancake and the fresh squeezed oj. My husband enjoyed his burrito but it was small compared to the price. I really wanted to like this place but if we visit SB again we won't be coming here.
