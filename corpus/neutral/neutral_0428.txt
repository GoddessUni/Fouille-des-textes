I know people love this but I prefer my cous cous traditional the old Algerian way.
However, I tried their King Kong, basically a dozen shrimp overcooked and skewered accompanied by a mound of cous cous with multiple flavors, I get what they are trying to do...nouveau cous cous but it felt there was too much going on for my palate and the portions were small  Nice c.asual seating and reasonably priced, beer and wine and interesting rosemary lemonade, (though I watered it down more and it brought out more flavor)  AND YES the beetroot ice cream was delicious as promised by the faithful fans.
