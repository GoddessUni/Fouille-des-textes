I have been to Rx several times for brunch. My most recent visit was the first since the renovation. There is more room for seating inside, and we didn't have to wait so that is a positive. The interior is a sunny yellow, but the decor is otherwise very plain. Now that the dark wood apothecary shelving is gone, it could use a little something on the walls to give it more atmosphere.

The brunch menu has the standards covered - Eggs Benedict and its typical variations, oatmeal, french toast, Huevos Rancheros, etc. No Bloody Marys, of course, since it's a byob. The sound level is extremely loud. There are few soft materials to absorb the sound and it really reverberates, which I do not like when I am hoping for a calm, restorative breakfast. I had the Eggs Sardou, which is their version of Benedict with salmon. The poached eggs were rather runny, and the spinach was too wet and was under seasoned, and there was just too much of it. The potatoes were well seasoned and cooked. I also tried the Huevos Rancheros. The dish looked messy and the beans were too firm, but otherwise it was good for a hangover. Cheesy and salty and saucy and eggy. My other dining companion ordered the Chipped Beef which I did not try but he loved it and cleaned his plate. 

The service is a little shaky. There was no hostess station, so it was a little confusing when you walked inside. But the servers were quick and pleasant - just lacking a little polish. Much better than my previous experiences so I am hoping they will continue to improve.

Also, I cannot help but think it's weird that in 2010 a restaurant does not have a website. The above link to www.caferx.com is nothing, so it's impossible to find out their menu, hours, etc.
