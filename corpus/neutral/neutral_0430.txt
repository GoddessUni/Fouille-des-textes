This pizza place is the BEST pizza shop around for food!! The food is awesome. From the cheesteak pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, Italian  hoagies, and cheesteaks!! All these people saying the food isn't good must have eaten somewhere else!! The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is because of the customer service and the delivery time!! Delivery always takes an hour or more even on week days.  If their that busy hire another delivery driver. Customer service isn't always pleasant and on Yelp when you check in they give you have a coupon.  Well, I used it once and they were obviously mad about it and laughing at me on the other side of the phone. They also made my double steak and cheese sandwich a single even though I paid for double!  There are many reasons  this pizza place makes me mad, but honestly they do have the best food around!
