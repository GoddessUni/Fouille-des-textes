My family and I have been coming here for 13 years. Back then, we used to come here to do ALL of our grocery shopping, but now, they're a little more pricey than they used to be. 
They have a buffet inside, we only went there when we were younger... I'm not sure the hours, but their food isn't bad at all... It's pretty good. Some of their stuff is just a tad bit bland, so you might want to add some salt. 
Their redskin potato salad used to be my ALL TIME FAV. Now, I still enjoy it, but you can get a bad batch every now and then. (The potato isn't cooked completely) 
I remember one night when my family and I were out late and we stopped by the "fried" area. (Or that's what I like to call it... it's near the deli area...) We got some onion rings and expected them to be decent... Though, they were pretty bad, they were greasy as all get out. The grease leaked through the bag by the time we got home. The breading was also not good... 
They have a very nice bakery area! When I was little, they used to keep chocolate chip cookies out for free (Of course you only take 1). Now, they don't do that because of the crappy teens who would take about 10 of them or would just stand there and eat the whole jar... sad how they had to ruin that. Though, I remember asking for a cookie to the lady who was there at the time and she gave me one from behind the counter. :)
Landis is very clean... Never have I ever seen anything that was dirty... The floor is always clean.
We live about 4-5 minutes away from here, so we still come here every now and then. The prices are just so high! I remember my parents came and bought only 3-4 bags of groceries and it came out to be about $80! 
I think the whole staff knows each other because I tried to get a job here as a bagger or cashier (You can bag once you're 14) and they told me they only hire people they know... Though, they are very friendly indeed!
