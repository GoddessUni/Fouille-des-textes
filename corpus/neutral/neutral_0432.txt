5 stars for cool beers, 1 star for German food.

Their beer selection and in-house brews just make ya want to drink more and try em' all! Most of the people there were drinking, not eating, and now I know why. 

Perhaps we ordered the wrong food or were there on a bad night, but we were not at all impressed with the food. I ordered the Jagerschnitzel with spaetzl - absolutely huge portion (size of entire large plate) of schnitzel (dry, bland, and a little tough) covered in a cream sauce with mushrooms (reminded me a Campbell's cream of mushroom soup with some wine added - blech). The spaetzl was nothing special and a little rubbery. BF ordered the homemade sausages (1 pork, 1 chicken) with hot German potato salad - sausages were soooooooo dry it was hard to eat and potato salad was like boiled potatoes in pickle juice - blech. Both entrees were pricy ($16 for schnitzel, $12 for 2 sausages). 

Server was super friendly and interior is inviting and pleasant.
