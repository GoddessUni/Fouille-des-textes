We've eaten at Cafe Audrey every weekend since we first tried it. The food is decent and the atmosphere is pretty nice. I'm not a huge fan of open floor seating, but they're working with what they've got. The servers are always quick and very friendly. My only recommendation would be to hire a hostess/cashier. The owner of the restaurant tries to do everything herself and this means you may have to wait to get your name on the list or wait to pay. Even if servers aren't busy they won't seat you because the owner keeps the waiting list on her at all times. Things would be a lot smoother if she'd leave it up front and let the servers help seat people.
