I feel very so-so about this restaurant. I feel like they could be awesome, but they're just... not. 

Prices are decent, food is decent, service is decent, everything is decent. The chip sauce is great. Put it on everything. It makes everything better. 

I had a chicken, bacon, ranch sandwich & a Caesar side salad. Side salad was okay, but over dressed as per usual for middle of the road restaurants. Chicken sandwich was good and fresh, but a little on the plain side. But then I put chip sauce on it and it was much better. 

I'd be willing to go back, but it's not super high on my list. Well, maybe for the chip sauce.
