Let me start off with the food was very good.  The service on the other hand...NOT SO MUCH!  Greeted and seated by a very pleasant young man.  Bartender, Ashley waited on us and was not a pleasant individual.  No smile, bad vibe altogether.  Ordered and specifically said no tomatoes on a salad, there were tomatoes on the salad!  She took it away and when she brought it back about dumped it on the floor and just dropped it at the table with attitude!  Another server delivered our food, very pleasant and reassured us the order was correct and read it back to us as he set it on the table.  . Ashley checked on us once and my husband asked for ketchup and again threw it on the table as she walked by.  
When you work in the public, especially for tips, attitude is everything!  If your in a pissy mood before work, check it at the door on your arrival to work.  Fake it, whatever you need to do to not poison the atmosphere with your negativity!  I hope her manager shows her this review!
