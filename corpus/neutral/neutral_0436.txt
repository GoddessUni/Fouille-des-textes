After having come here for literally over 30 years, this place is good, bad, ugly, and well everything in between.

The midway games are great and one of the few super kid friendly places that are part of a tourist visit. They have dart games, basketball freethrows, softball throws, water spray guns, star shootouts, etc... You can win any of a million types of stuffed animals, which makes for an exceedingly happy munchkin. I can absolutely vouch for this, as I was one of those munchkins more than once!

Pro Tip #1: Free parking in the parking structure across the street! It also helps that they have a heated enclosed pathway to walk over to the rest of the hotel!

The Casino games are typical and somedays pay and somedays dont. That entirely depends on your current luck and how you are feeling. My favorite was watching someone walk up to a roulette wheel and bet black red black on three consecutive spins and walk away with $3,000!!! awesome stuff!

Pro Tip #2: There is a walkway to the silver legacy and el dorado hotel & casinos that is enclosed over the roads, so you can block hop without going outside.

The hotel rooms are kinda bleh no frills and bland standard rooms. Nothing spectacular but not a roach motel either. Just make sure you are not expecting too much from the hotel room IMHO...

The midway also has a trapeze act and that is definitely fun for people of all ages. I dont know anyone who isnt captivated watching people floating through the air from one trapeze to another while flying 50+ feet above the net. Awesome stuff. I do enjoy it totally!
