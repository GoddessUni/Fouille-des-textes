I wish this review was based only on the food so I could give it 5 stars but it's not. I ordered a burger that was very good and all of the drinks were good..... when I could get my waitress to come take my orders. She was a dark haired girl named Amanda and she had a very unfriendly attitude. I waited a very long time for her to return to my table for food orders and drink refills. Anytime I asked her for anything she acted like I was asking her to go out of her way to do a difficult task. I saw her spending a lot of time talking to other waitresses while I was waiting. I will probably come back to this location but I will be looking for a better server.
