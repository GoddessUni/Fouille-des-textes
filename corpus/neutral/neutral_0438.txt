I'm a big fan of Metropolitan Bakery, so I was looking forward to trying the pizza here. Unfortunately, I left disappointed. I had the sausage pizza, with fennel & red onion. The sausages were good, although I wished there were a few more. The problem with the pizza is the crust. It tastes fine, but even with the edges slightly crisp the bottom of the pizza is not at all crisp. Even though the slices are small, you can't hold up a slice with one hand and eat it, without the crust going completely limp and the slice falling apart. My co-worker's pizza was the same way. With so many places to get pizza, Metropolitan has got to do better to get my repeat business.

My meal ended with a slice of chocolate cake. The same cake you can get next door at the bakery. It's very rich and very good, but I can just grab this at the bakery for take out without coming into the cafe.

Service was friendly but a bit slow as there was no communication between the person making pizza and the person slicing the cake. If u order both u have to make sure u communicate that the cake in one place goes with the pizza being handed to you in another place. At first I didn't realize that was my responsibility.
