The waiter was so nice I feel bad criticizing. It's just that I've been living in the Middle East for the past 3 years and this was merely a B+ experience. And it's too expensive. The chicken kabob was tender but bland. The beef kefta was not bland, but the spices were nothing special. The grape leaves also weren't very tasty. On the vegetarian platter, the hummus was much too clumpy and hard to dip. Didn't care for the Baba Ganoush or the eggplant dip. The one stand out were the Arabic fries. And my father loved the lentil soup. The decor is dated and not too attractive. Don't think I'll be back.
