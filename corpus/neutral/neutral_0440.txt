After weighing my options, I decided I did want an early breakfast before my flight. I was at gate B10, so Wolfgang Puck Express was conveniently located-- and had a hot breakfast option that sounded promising. I ordered the classic breakfast -- sans toast -- to go (roughly $15.50). 

I can't speak to the "dine in" experience, but my to go order was just fine. It was maybe 5:45 am when I ordered (like I said, early breakfast!) and the cashier was... quite tired? She didn't smile, spoke in a monotone voice, and seemed pretty uninterested in being there. I can't really blame her that early, and I do think she was just tired, but it wasn't the best experience for a first time guest. 

The food was made fresh, and it took maybe ten minutes or so to get my order. They weren't busy when I popped in. The eggs were okay, so was the sausage. The potatoes were really good, but I only ate a couple before realizing they might've had flour on them (and I am gluten free). Normally I'd check beforehand, but this early, I didn't think to. Anyway, overall the food was decent and as someone who can't grab a bagel or breakfast sandwich, it was nice to have a hot option to take my morning supplements with. It felt just slightly overpriced-- I've paid similarly for this kind of meal outside of an airport, though, so wasn't too bothered. 

I'd probably give them another shot if the opportunity arose-- at least for a to go order.
