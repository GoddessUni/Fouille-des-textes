Another new bistro sports bar with TV screens and the usual food fare.  No beer specials.  Which is unfortunate as every other bar just a block away  such as the Tilted Kilt, The Local, Joeys Sherwood, and the Canadian Brewhouse have them.  For that reason alone I won't be back.  As noted in the previous review food is not special.  And the piped in music is too loud, especially when there are only 6 patrons in the place. Atmosphere is nice and sort of upscale.  Not sure why they have 2 tiny TVs on each side of the bar; should be a little larger.  Ample free parking.  Open til 2:00am Thur to Sat at least for now...
