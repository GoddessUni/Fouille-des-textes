Beautiful bar, delicious drinks, but way too crowded! If I'm spending $15+ per drink, I don't want to have to elbow my way to the bar and then stand around in a huge, noisy crowd. This place just didn't have the vibe I was expecting for a nice hotel bar. No music, no seats. The few available couches and chairs were completely full, and the bar itself lacked seating. Really a shame for the potential it has.
That said, service was surprisingly good. The bartenders were doing their best, considering what they had to deal with.
If you're looking for a quiet, classy place to grab a fancy cocktail, I'd look elsewhere. We finished our drinks quickly and took off immediately.
