Made a reservation a week ahead for a party of 10. They seemed very accommodating on the phone and assured me they could make something for the vegan member of my party.  However, after having to give my credit card info to reserve our dinner, I was disappointed with the service at dinner. We arrived on time and had our wine opened immediately, but then were completely ignored for almost an hour.  I finally requested menus for our party and while they were apologetic about the wait, it was still another 20 minutes before our order was taken.  At this point, the whole group was starving, and we requested bread. The bread was delicious but we only received one piece per person and requested more while we waited.  Despite the long wait, the food was outstanding.  In particular, we loved the gnocchi in the wine reduction, gorgonzola and apple pizza, and wild boar risotto.  Overall, the food is amazing, the prices reasonable, the atmosphere is adorable, and it's nice not to be rushed in and out, but the restaurant was just not able to handle this large a party. I would have preferred to be told this when I called to make the reservation. I definitely plan to return with a much smaller party for the delicious food!
