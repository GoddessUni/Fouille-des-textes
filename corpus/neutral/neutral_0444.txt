Freddy Hill is a great place to go miniature golfing.  They have 2 courses to choose from.  We like the batting cages because you can pick the speed and baseball/softball.  I haven't tried the driving range yet.  The kids that work the mini golf and batting cages were nice.  I'm not a fan of the ice cream - better options in the area and I think it is pricey for what it is.  They have a Fall fest that gets very crowded and parking is difficult but the years they have Columbus Day - Columbus Day is more affordable and less crowded.  I do recommend the Hay ride and you can pay to pick a pumpkin.  It's good supporting a local business.
