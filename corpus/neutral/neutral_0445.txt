If I were to review this place two years ago, I might had given it a 3.5 or 4 star..

Now, from my past three visits at Cafe Osage, I think a 2 star is more appropriate.. However, I'm giving it a 3 because the "farm-to-table", "garden next to kitchen" concept..

A concise summary of how I'd rate this place is: Great concept, inconsistent quality, and terrible service.. 

I mentioned the concept above, it's fantastic.

Onto the meals, my guess is that the sous chef probably substitute as the chef and they are at very different levels.. Or the waiters cook as well? Not sure exactly what's going on in the kitchen but the quality of food have been so inconsistent that I dare not to bring friends here (I used to bring friends here for brunch a lot).. 

And the service... argh... Hire more people? Hire someone more experienced? Train your people? I really hate to see a restaurant not becoming more successful because of the service but I can see it happening here..
