Solid deli.  I had the Rueben and I thought it was pretty good.  The potato salad was so/so.  My buddy got the roast beef dip.  He thought the meat was over cooked/dry and really needed the au jus, which was odd since I had just read reviews that the sandwich stood on its own without the au jus.  The brought my sandwich out fairly quickly and the. My buddies sandwich took a long time to come out.  That was odd too, but I really appreciated  the gentleman working brought us a $5 off our next visit because of the wait.  It really wasn't needed but it was a nice touch showing they care about customer service.  I look forward to coming back cause I think they have potential to get a 4th star from me, but this visit was a 3 star visit.
