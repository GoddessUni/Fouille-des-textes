I really really want to love Paganos as it is so close to my new office and the outdoor seating is a huge plus. They have so much seating its hard not to get a seat! 

I have been for lunch twice so far and both times spent way more than I had expected.  It is always busy so you know it is good..the lines keep moving pretty quickly. They have a salad bar in the middle that I've noticed can be a bit sparse..a pizza kitchen in the back and a fresh deli counter in the middle. I've eyed up the bar both times I have visited but since with co-workers...had to pass.

Today I got the turkey BLT on sourdough which was delicious and huge I only had half..but I'm sure I'll finish the rest before the day is out. I also asked for a side of the salad which was also delicious but only like filled about half of a small to go container. Plus a water and my total was $17 and change.

Previously I went with another coworker, I got the BBQ pulled pork sandwich which was great! But my last bite of my 1st half was a huge piece of BBQ cartilage...yuck! I'm one of those people who if I get surprised by a crunchy item that isn't supposed to be there I can't eat anymore. So I disposed of the other half...it did come with fries (obviously at a cost) but they were probably some of the best damn fries I've ever had! I believe that lunch totaled around $16 and change.

I will definitely be back but I'm still trying to figure out how to spend $10 or less on lunch...if anyone has any special tricks or secrets fill me in! I'm not sure if it is against the rules but I'll probably get one of those $5 platters from a food truck and occupy their beautiful seating.. :)
