This business has actually relocated in to the target parking lot at Roger and Oracle. No improvement on the location, it was actually easier easier to access when it was on Limberlost. It's on the corner of the parking lot and getting in and out of that parking lot is a nightmare because the target is always busy. When I went there, the application to order on the phone  was down, their system was out, and the wait time for a simple cheese ready to go pizza was 20 minutes. Pizza was not that good for six bucks. I'll go elsewhere next time and save the hassle. Workers are required to be masked  by a Tucson city mandate and they were not wearing their masks. They were down on the chin and everywhere else in the middle of a pandemic. Workers however we're very good and kind of rolls with the flow and remained courteous in spite of everything thrown at them
