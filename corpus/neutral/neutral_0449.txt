I came to Bisbee Breakfast Club after seeing the menu online mentioned "gluten free options." It was 9:00am on a Thursday and the place was packed. The decor is sort of modern 50's style, everything was clean and neat with cool blue walls and ceiling tiles that look like a Tetris game. Our server was super friendly but I felt bad for her because she had so many tables and couldn't spend too much time refilling coffee or checking to see how our food was. The food was good overall but not super fantastic. I wanted to love my gluten free pancakes but they were quite dry. The bacon was also tiny. My dining companion ordered the biscuits and gravy after seeing one of their gloriously fluffy biscuits on another table. He thought the biscuit was excellent but wanted the gravy to have more sausage and seasoning.
