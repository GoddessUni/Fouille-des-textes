Just visited today for a second time.  The first time, my husband and I sat in the dining room and a little spring roll app and some rice.  We liked it and we promised we would be back to sit at the sushi bar.  This time we sat at the sushi bar- first of all- Great customer service.  I had the Spanish Springs Roll-I liked it.  My husband had the Spicy Tuna Roll- the tuna was mushy (not normal).  Next, my husband had Scallop roll- we liked it.  And then we tried the Dragon Roll- heavy and rich.  Overall the food was good, not the greatest.  We will probably be back again to try other things on their-and we always like to support local business, I just hope it's better next time.
