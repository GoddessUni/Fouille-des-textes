After loving their Gentilly location, I have to say I was disappointed in the new place. My VooDoo Burger just wasn't the same...the steak fries were not as buttery and decadent...my salad was your standard salad...overall, it was just OK. On the other hand, Chef Jordan's (I think it was Jordan) Side Car was STUPENDOUS. Like awesome. That made up for everything else. The Munch Punch was pretty good too (albeit sweet). If you're only in town for a little while, sadly the Munch Factory shouldn't make your list. If you live in town and you just want some diner food, hit up the Munch and definitely order a sidecar;)
