I was glad that I tried this place. I happened to spot this Eatery as I was passing. I was intrigued by it's warm and inviting frontal. 

I decided to give it a try. My friend and I decided to have dinner and drinks here last night. Due to Yelp reviews as well as the overall menu, I decided to try the honey Sriracha shrimp bowl with extra shrimp. I was happy that I did order the extra shrimp which was about $7 upcharge. But I felt that the extra shrimp really make the dish extra special. However, the flavors overall were hit and miss in my mouth. I can't really explain it but I did feel that I left from having a filling meal but not one I was over the top tasty. 

I didn't try any of the drinks here but did order a Bud Light. My friend was on a vegan diet and so she tried one of the vegan dishes but got it returns as she was disappointed in the taste. Next, she was recommended by the waitress to order the veggie tacos. We weren't sure if the flour tortilla was vegan but it was a better bet for her to have a good dinner. Upon arrival, the dish did appear without much flavor. This filling looked dry or only coated with lemon juice. We expected the tacis to be packed with favor. Lacking flavor was exactly the way she described it. She did have hot sauce on the side. 

Overall I was happy to try this Eatery but definitely will only come here for drinks and maybe appetizers. The kale chips are the best I've ever had! Not only were they super seasoned but super fresh. You could tell that they were just made in the kitchen.
