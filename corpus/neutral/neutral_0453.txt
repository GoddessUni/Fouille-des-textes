Is Drinker's a meat-market with the average post-college/pre-career crowd? Yes. Are you often assaulted by a large crowd blowing cigarette smoke at the entrance if you attempt to go here post-work or late-evening? Yes. Will your friends be awkwardly stared down by other patrons if they are even mildly cute? Most likely. 

BUT do they have a naked photohunt machine, cheap pitchers and some pretty kickass nachos? Hells Bells. 

My advice, don't attempt to go to Drinker's during Happy Hour, late in the evening or even on a weekend. If you keep that in mind, it is the perfect spot to saddle up to the computer game machine, order a few pitchers and stumble your way out of the bar hours later without judgement. Drinker's brought me a lot of happiness when I was in grad school and dirt broke and needed some cheap thrills and drinks. For as much as it can sometimes suck, it really hits the spot when you want a laid back pitcher type of night. They also have a few big screen tv's for game watching and the layout of the place is pretty spacious if you don't attempt to visit during the above mentioned times. Good luck!
