I have eaten here quite a few times but this was my first experience since the menu changed substantially (earlier this spring) and unfortunately I give the change a thumbs down. I used to think of it as a place to get a number of delicious healthy options, but yesterday at lunch I had a hard time finding anything that wasn't heavy/fatty/fattening on the menu. I ordered the beet salad and it was "ok"--way more cabbage than beets (where's the beet!") and the dressing had a bottled French dressing quality. Also, the whole restaurant smelled like a kitchen fire (or should I say A.kitchenfire). The service and atmosphere (not counting the smoky smell) was just as lovely as it used to be. Unfortunately though, I am taking this one out of the rotation.
