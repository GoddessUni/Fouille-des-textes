AAA for cleanliness!!! There wasn't a crumb on a table when I walked in today around 1pm. This was my first visit here, and I immediately liked how the place sparkles, and it was void of clutter(except for some plants by the hostess.  I had Huevos and a beer and my tab was $20 + $4 tip. A little on the pricey side -Huevos was a small portion dish, but good. None of the staff seemed very happy to be there-rarely saw a smile and did not observe any interaction amongst the staff. I felt like they were all robots waiting to get off of work. No smiles to be had by anyone working there. I like the design of the place-very functional. One waitress with dark hair and a braid walked around like a zombie. I would have had a much better visit had the employees shown a little bit of enthusiasm for their jobs. Maybe it was the full moon........ I found the staff to be depressing. Food ok.
