I absolutely love the gelato, they have amazing flavors and a decent variety of sizes and cone options. However, it's the employees who always leave a bad taste in my mouth. 

When we entered the store today at about 8pm on a Tuesday, the place was empty. The young girl who served us was sitting down reading a book. No "hello" or "welcome in", she just got up off her stool and waiting till we asked to try flavors. The sour face she was making as I asked to try flavors made me almost uncomfortable to ask for another. But I did. 

After sampling 3 flavors I settled on Raspberry and Chocolate - which went just as well as chocolate covered raspberry's  would - and before I could even say "thanks" she's at the register reaching her hand out for my tender. She then asked if I wanted a receipt, I said "no", and waited to see if I needed to sign. Instead of a "thank you" or "have a nice day" she just walked away..without a word - beginning to serve the next customer who had just walked in. I just stood there in awe of the cold service we had just received. Not a single smile from this girl, I mean you're being served to scoop me Gelato, life can't be that hard can it? 

Despite their amazing Gelato I might rethink about spending my money here and rather, spend some time searching Santa Barbara for some Gelato places with better customer service.
