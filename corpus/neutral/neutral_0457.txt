My friends and I went here on New Year's eve for dinner before heading to Aloft for their New Year's party. The menu was prix fixe with a appetizer, salad, entree and dessert. They had a flamenco show with a 3 man band. This was a nice thought but in reality verged on obnoxious. We were seated at a long table that ran long-ways right up to the stage. We were one of the last couples to arrive and so we were unfortunately seated right next to the stage. We were literally screaming over each other to be heard and finally just stopped trying to converse because it was futile. The flamenco dancers were beautiful and talented. But the loud foot stopping so characteristic of flamenco made us feel like they were dancing on our heads. I had a raging headache throughout dinner. Serendipitously, the Sangria was delicious (possibly the best in Tampa) and it cured my headache nicely. 

Overall, the food was decent. The show was good. Just ask to be seated in the farthest corner away from the stage if you want to save your hearing and your sanity. Or just order lots of Sangria.
