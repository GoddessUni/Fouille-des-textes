Service is fantastic. Very kind server who tended to our needs, always made sure our glasses of water were filled, etc. Overall, just a kind human. No problems with staff. My issue is with the restaurant "rules" and "specials". Been really looking forward to dining at Anju since before it opened. It's so close to home, I can walk there or get a K-Pops fix to-go. They've recently begun offering daily specials, but they're dine-in only. That's problem number one. First off, pandemic is NOT over (yes, things are way better), but sometimes people just want a bite to eat during lunch and can't dine-in, simple as that. This time around, I did happen to have the time to dine-in for this special and did so, only to find out that the $2 I got off my meal was then added as an additional charge because I asked for the Soy Garlic sauce. Isn't that part of my meal?! A choice of either Soy Garlic OR St. Pete Heat? Why then was I charged $2 for one and .50 for the second? So there goes the "special" price. It was completely unexpected and we weren't told in advance that adding a side of sauce would cost more.
