The food here is actually REALLY good!!! They're kind of slow at preparing it but, it's worth the wait. The chicken fingers are seasoned so well. The portions are good & tasty. The reason for 3 stars is pricing... it's $12 for a burger. It clearly says "burger" they however charge an extra $2 for a burger patty. It's only $12 for the chicken.... seriously? If it's $14 for a burger then just put it on the menu as $14! Don't advertise one thing then up charge your customers for the very item you advertised differently. I'm adding pics to show these discrepancies. Otherwise, it's a great new place with an awesome rooftop bar.
