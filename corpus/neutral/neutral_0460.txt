It was a chilly December night and the original restaurant we wanted to check out was closed. Mother's was right across the street from our hotel and judging from the long line for lunch over the weekend, we decided to give it a try. The restaurant is located among hotel chains and has an old school sign hanging outside. 

We went late on a weekday so there wasn't a line outside, but there sure was a line on the inside. There was even a security guard standing by the door! For cafeteria style food, the line went by slowly. We finally ordered and got: 

World's Best Baked Ham Dinner ($13) - red beans & rice, green beans & tomatoes, and turnip greens. The baked ham was the only option left and was dry. The sides were decent, but nothing to rave about. 

Combination Platter ($20) - Crawfish etouffee, potato salad, jambalaya, red beans & rice, and grits. The etouffee, jambalaya, and potato salad were so good! They were the redeeming sides of the night. The grits were completely bland and needed as much seasoning and butter as you could handle. 

We ate about half our food and were stuffed. Thank goodness there was a fridge in our hotel room!
