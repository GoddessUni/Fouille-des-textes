LOVED THIS PLACE! Met my ex here, and we still are best friends. Ate here once a week for almost 20 years. Are there new owners? Woman who waited on us yesterday wanted to charge us for any condiments that we were taking with us, when taking the leftovers home...WHAT? Also asked us to pay an extra .50 for each soup container. A man who had waited on us for years came over, told us never mind. Hey, met a husband here, divorced said husband, and we still eat here. Don't try and hit me for nonsense charges. I've been in love with Pho 777 from my first time, till 20 years later. The food is amazing, your prices WERE the best in town. Hey inflation, we all have to deal with it. But, don't hit me with charges for condiments, or containers. Your prices are now the same as every other Pho in town, fast way to loose customers.
