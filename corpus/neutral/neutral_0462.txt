It was our first time here this weekend and This seems like a really nice place . They allow dogs on the patio which is really cool and the Wine is pretty good . The one downside is that They don't carry any Ro≈õe which is atypical given the time of year but I think I would still go back .
After coming back to try it out for a second time I think I had to revise my review considering our visit here yesterday evening. The wine we had was and is very good . The petite Verdot was the best part & actually tasted perfect to me . Unfortunately What left a bad taste in my mouth was before my husband and I could finish ordering our wine from the lady at the bar she asked if we were paying together or separate , like it even mattered . I felt it was quite rude given this place doesn't exactly have table service to presume that or possibly a rookie mistake on her end because she's obviously new .(can't imagine an owner saying something like that ?) Anyway I told her I could pay so I did and she was nice enough afterwards but thinking about that experience convinced me we won't be back and probably wouldn't recommend considering there are other wine bars up the street.
