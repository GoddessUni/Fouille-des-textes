Craving some Italian dessert. I need to eat some good cannoli and lobster tail. I walked all the way to Italian market and got in this small bakery. 
Need to warn you, the ladies who worked there, they must be super busy with non stop customers. They don't want to be bothered so do not ask any question...

My cannoli... Ok.. Wasn't bad. But not as good as the one at Veniero's in NYC but definitely better than the Bruno's or petitio's. Lobster tail was ok. Pastries were well baked but their custard cream was just ok. I'm general their fillings were nothing special to me. I would never crave their filling though. 

Unexpected jackpot was carrot cake. Not too sweet but their cream cheese icing was amazing. Now I am craving their carrot cake though. 

If the ladies there were little nicer, at least answer your questions w/o being annoyed I would give them 4 star because of their carrot cake.
