I thought I would give Desi Tadka another chance....

What another expensive disappointment! Some years back I used to go here all the time and the food was always great but I hadn't been back since late 2019, which was the last time I had ordered take out. It was at that time, I noticed how the portion sizes had gotten a lot smaller and the prices had gotten higher. Very expensive, especially for the amount of food you get. 
But...this past weekend I thought well, I'll try them again, only because there aren't any really  good Indian restaurants in our area anymore. 
I explained to the manager about my prior experience and he explained the portions were served in 16oz containers and are the same as if you were to eat in the restaurant. 
Reluctantly, I went ahead and placed an order rather than following my instinct to leave. I usually get a few different entrees to share between the 4 of us. My my ordered consisted of: 1 Samosa, 1 veggie app and then our entrees were two orders of Chicken Tikka Masala, Curry Shrimp and Channa Masala and then 3 orders of Naan (which were $3.99 each...seriously?). 
After about 30 minutes, I was presented with two half full plastic carry-out bags and a bill for $98 ($20 more than in 2019). The bill, plus a beer and then a small tip, I walked out spending $108. The food portions were still small and ended up not being enough to feed everyone and just lacked that depth of flavor one expects when ordering Indian food, even the basmati rice was absent of its signature floral aroma and nutty flavor.  
 
I really just need to find a new Indian Restaurant.
