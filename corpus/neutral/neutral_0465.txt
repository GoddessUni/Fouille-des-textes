Not too much to say about E & C.  It was the restaurant attached to the Crowne Plaza lobby, so my group went for a snack and a drink in the late afternoon.  It was crowded because of a basketball game, so lots of sports fanatics, but it wasn't as loud and crazy as one would expect.

Waitress was crazy busy but did get things done quickly, so I wasn't too concerned.  She did have a bit of a 'tude, but whatever.

I ordered a Side Car, which was done well for only $7.  My two friends ordered Grey Goose Cosmos for $14 a piece.  Significant jack up in price when asking for the Goose, which we discovered is the trend in Philly.  When did Philly become so expensive.  It wasn't this way when lived here.  I also ordered French Onion soup, which was tasty and piping hot.

All in all, nothing special.  2.5 stars if I could do so.  Went purely for the convenience of being in the lobby of my hotel.
