My daughter is a fan of Red Robin.  We do not have one immediately near us so after an appointment in the area we drove over for lunch.  This was my first time at the restaurant.

I ordered a chophouse burger (I think that is what it was called).  It was tasty.  I liked that I was offered a temperature (pink or no pink).  So many burger joints stray away from that.  The burger tasted fine.  It should at $10+.  It wasn't worth that.  The bottomless steak fries is a nice touch.

I also ordered a salted caramel shake.  I have mixed feelings about it.  Overall it was fine, but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be; I will not order it again.

Service was iffy.
