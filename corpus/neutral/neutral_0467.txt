First time visiting this place. Ordered three items togo and i only waited 5min or less. I thought I heard it wrong when my name was called for the food. Lol. Never had any Chinese have been served this quick or any food for that matter. The staff are extremely friendly and easy going. Seems like they got lots regulars using this restaurant.  That only means that  the food and the service are always upto the customers standard. Food can be outstanding but with horrible service manners, it is harder to enjoy the food. But here, the quality of food and the service meets to keep the customers satisfied with their choices and visits. However, i found the food to be bit blend and i do agree with other reviews that more ingredients need to be used. Ex. The ratio of vegetable /pork in fried pork rice was not met. If I would not have never guessed it would be a bbq pork rice if I didn't know ahead. Same withe the sweet and sour chicken and seafood chow mein.  It could have been better if there was more seafood in the chow mein and more meat in the batter of sweet and sour chicken.   
Overall little add of hot sauce and soy sauce did me good.it was delicious and fresh.
