Honestly, it was pretty underwhelming. 

Our waitress, Tori, was incredible. Very helpful and knowledgeable.  

Mentioned our anniversary on reservation, no remark or gesture towards that. Mention a moment like that at Capital Grille or St. Elmo's and you'll get a very different experience than here. 

In retrospect, I should have sent my medium filet back as it was well overcooked, mostly gray with a slightly pink middle. Resulted in an "ok" steak, and I don't like to complain so I just ate it. Definitely not a $50 steak experience. Corn side was delicious, green beans were very salty but good. Risotto and fish of the day were tasty. 

Walked away thinking it was a nice meal, but with 2 sides, 2 drinks, 2 entrees at nearly $200 after tip... no thanks. 

It seems like Red is benefitting from a Yelp Elite opening party, which usually generates a solid amount of 5's. I'll wait this place out for another 6+ months to see what a true rating looks like from customers, but I don't think our experience would have us back here soon... especially considering all the options around the corner.
