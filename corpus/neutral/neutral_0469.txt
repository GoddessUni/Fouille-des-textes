Giorgio's on Pine is a cute BYO with an extremely hospitable owner, friendly staff and, as Jim H. mentioned, a very easy-on-the-eyes chef.  Highlights for me were the service, hospitality, décor and desserts.  Our group had several bottles of wine on the table, and we never had to wait for our server to open another bottle--she was all over it.  We started off with baskets of delicious bread and garlicky olive oil, and a plate of bruschetta was dropped off at our table, gratis.  

I had the grilled calamari appetizer and wasn't crazy about it.  I've been spoiled by the delicious calamari at Dmitri's and have not met a matching squid since.  I felt more optimistic about my entrée selection, gnocchi with a braised beef ragout.  I was hoping for a similar dish to the one served at Mercato, which is absolutely fantastic.  Unfortunately, the two were not at all comparable.  The gnocchi didn't do anything for me and the ragout was entirely too bitter.  The beef was few and far between and tasted like plain old ground meat.  I ditched my entrée and went back to my old standby, the bread basket.

Giorgio's hit a much higher note with desserts.  While I didn't agree that the tiramisu was "the best in the city," I did enjoy it.  The other desserts I tried were all appealing as well--bread pudding that had a crunchy texture to some of the outside pieces (mmm), chocolate mousse and another very rich chocolate cake type thing, which was another complimentary addition to our meal.  

Despite not being crazy over my own dinner, others at my table seemed happy with their selections.  I'd be willing to give Giorgio's another shot, and plan to do so in the near future.
