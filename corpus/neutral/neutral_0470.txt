This was my first visit to a Pita Jungle, and I thought it was good, but I was not blown away.  I'm no stranger to Mediterranean food, and I shared the sampler platter with my friend to try a bit of everything.  I've had better versions of everything before, but nothing was bad.  The only dish that really impressed me at lunch was the caramelized cauliflower.   I'd like to come back here during their happy hour, and try a few tapas sized plates on their patio, but I won't be seeking it out for a meal.  

On my visit, I was with a friend and her daughter, and we were both annoyed that they brought out the adult's food probably about 20 minutes before her 5 year old daughter received the meal.  If anyone knows anything about dining with children, this is a complete faux pas.  Especially, when her daughter ordered a pita with cheese on it.
