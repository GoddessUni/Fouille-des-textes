I normally love South Coast Deli. Their sandwiches and salads are delicious but I'm just a little sad with them this time. I ordered a Fowl Play salad online and asked for the dressing on the side. When I went to go pick it up, they just gave me the bowl of salad. I asked them I asked for the dressing on the side but they looked at the bowl and said it was mixed in with the salad already. I walked home and looked and my salad didn't have any dressing on it. It might have been an innocent mistake but I'm just sad that I paid $11 for a bland salad.
