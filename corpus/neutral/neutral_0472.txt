my husband's been wanting to come here for awhile so we finally did. I'm not a whiskey girl so I stuck with water but the three other people ordered whiskey related drinks and they all seemed to enjoy it. their food, though, was really good for the most part. I wasn't impressed at all by the gnocchi, it was dry and kind of bland. and the asparagus didn't even eat because it didn't look all that appetizing. their mussels were delicious. not over or under cooked. the sauce for the mussels were superb. we actually asked for more bread to dip into the sauce and basically licked the plate clean! 

in terms of meats, we got the ribeye, flank, filet mignon... all medium rare. it did not disappoint. the ribeye was very flavorful, the filet mignon had the perfect amount of char, the flank had a delicious chimichurri sauce that was probably the best thing I've tasted. I really appreciated how perfectly they cooked all our meats.

I'm interested in coming back and checking out their seafood dishes. they sounded really great!

other than the food, the location is prime... though finding street parking may be difficult. the ambiance was nice. great outdoor seating for not-so-sweltering stl summers. service was attentive.
