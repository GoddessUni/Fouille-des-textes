This review is for their Chicken Pho (Pho Ga) only. 
If you're ordering chicken pho -- the honest opinion is 2/5 stars.. I've definitely experienced better. But I rounded to a 3 star, since this location isn't known for their chicken pho and I don't feel like a lower rating is fair as this is the only dish I tried.

$6.75 including tax, so your standard pho price. The broth is light, but not very flavorful at all. The chicken is not bone-in, as the menu states it is " shredded chicken". Some of the chicken was very tender -- some of the pieces were undercooked unfortunately and that's a big NO-NO for chicken.

Would not return for chicken pho. I've heard great things about their beef pho though
