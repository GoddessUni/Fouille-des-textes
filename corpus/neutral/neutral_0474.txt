Decided to check this place out based on decent reviews.  Food is actually really good, oysters were killer, chowder was awesome, sea bass was good as well.  Also I would definitely recommend the au gratin potatoes.  The reason I don't give this place any more than 3 stars is the horrible service.  Alan was our server and it took him until we were almost done to ask us how dinner was.  Additionally I had to ask for another drink as my wine glass was empty and we also had to ask for a desert menu.  I think this place is normally top notch but they definitely failed tonight.
