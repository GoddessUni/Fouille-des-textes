My sister and I ordered delivery from here for the first time.  The service was good, but the food was slightly above mediocre.  We got a chicken and a vegetarian burrito and the Nopal salad.  The burritos were fine, except they were missing the salsa we had asked for.  They were big and pan fried on one side to seal the goodies in, which was nice.  I asked for guacamole and there was a blob of it in the middle but no more to be seen.  The salad tasted very strange and salty.  The "balsamic vinaigrette" on the side was cold and solid and still very goopy when heated up.  I was surprised due to the great reviews, but maybe the pizza is the way to go if we order from here again.
