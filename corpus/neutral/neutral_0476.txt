A lunch stop for my group on a Sunday, not my choice but birthday girl's.
Union Station is a ghost town around this time and also looks like a war zone with all the construction. Was not sure if the place was still open from the outside. 
Inside, a few highlights, first the hometown boys made good, Mr. Chuck Berry of course, and it was nice to see Story of the Year represented well too. Alice Coopers 'Elected' hat and coat. Paul Stanley's guitar.
Tip - validated parking available in the Rock Shop (free with $10 purchase).
Food - the cheeseburgers delivered to another table looked good. 
My date and I opted for the nachos with pulled pork on them. They went down well but my tummy was not very happy afterwards. Me or the nachos?
Tip - If weather permits, the seating area outside actually seemed nice.
