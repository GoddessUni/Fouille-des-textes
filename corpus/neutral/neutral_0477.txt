Did a little pit stop on our way to Tennessee from Chicago for some breakfast.  Researched a couple places and came across this little hot spot in downtown Indi.  

Been to Indi a few times now an four vegan experiences have been great but was left a bit disappointed by this place.

Their coffee is self serve kinda like at Panera with a variety of options.  The flavor this morning was banana nut.  It smelled better than it tasted tho.  I also tried their regular brew n It was way too strong, almost a burnt taste.  Def wasn't my "cup o tea". 

I had the vegan omelette (basically veggies wrapped in what looked like a crepe) n my daughter the vegan avocado toast.  Both left us feeling hungry n missing something. 

My husband and son however ordered egg salad sandwich n waffles!  They both LOVED their dish!  

So I guess although they have vegan options it seems like their regular menu offers tastier items.
