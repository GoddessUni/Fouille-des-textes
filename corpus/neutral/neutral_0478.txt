Good Ol' Piggly Wiggly. I have somewhat of a love hate relationship with this place. I don't exactly like shopping with pictures of grocery store bandits hanging up but they are just too convenient and aid in my laziness. The produce here is hit or miss. Sometimes they have perfectly nice fruits and veggies and then at times its super bruised and not appealing at all. The meat selection is super solid. The prices are reasonable and somehow the cuts always inspire my meals (don't ask me why). I wouldn't come here for toiletries or household goods unless it's an emergency because the prices are steep and products are cheaply made. Mainly just come for meat and produce oh and beer. Albeit sketchy it gets the job done if you don't feel like driving too far out and it's pretty convenient to just hop in and hop out. Lock your car though :)
