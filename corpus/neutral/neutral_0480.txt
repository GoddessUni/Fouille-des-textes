Tempted to deduct two stars.  Only taking off one since the quality of the food is still on point.  

Tried delivery for the first time.  They charge a $3 delivery fee, though my rental was only 8 blocks away.  That, plus generous tip (because delivery fee implies to my apt door, not me having to drop what I'm doing to find shoes, shlep to the street, and meet the driver), brings a SMALL calzone to $25.

Then this happens:

Drive: Calling so you know to come down.
Me:     Is the building door locked?  I can buzz you up.
Drive: I don't know.  I'm not even there yet.  You have to come down.
Me:    .....................oooookay......

Call Top Tomato:

Me:   Hi.  Just received delivery, and am wondering if it's normal that your drivers make the 
        customer meet them on the street.
TT:   Yeah.  If they can't find parking....
Me:  .....................oooookay......

Obviously not worth discussing further, since the restaurant doesn't care, this driver didn't even know if there was parking as he called before he arrived, didn't have the courtesy to explain this on the phone, and the restaurant just wants a reason to charge you more, but not give you the service for which you're paying.

If you're going to have to dress and head outside anyway, just do pick up or dine in.  Don't bother wasting your money paying for a service which will be given in a very half-assed, honey badger manner.
