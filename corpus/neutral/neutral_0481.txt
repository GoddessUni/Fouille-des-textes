Office-mates decided to beat the crowd by lunching on May 4. We were seated in the main dining room, which is quite festive and colorful. It's really big!

Chips and salsa were immediately on the table. The salsa is fine-tasting, but a little thin, so you tend to splatter drops of it from the chip on the way to your mouth.

We all three chose from the lunch menu, where you order by number. Two got the three enchiladas (one chicken, one beef, one cheese). I got the cheese-chicken enchiladas.

All came with refried beans and cilantro rice. I think they were all between $6 and $7.

The meals were, as always, fine and dandy, but a little pedestrian. The beans had a little white cheese on top that gave them some additional flavor. The cilantro rice is tastier than plain old rice.

Beverages were diligently replenished. Our server was polite and attentive.

Nobody got the roasted corn and tomato soup on this visit. Now I wish I had. It steals the show!

Nobody got a to-go vessel either. Leftovers were just that -- left on the plates.
