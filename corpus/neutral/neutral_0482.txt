Disappointing experience. Very nice decor and good location, but for a few loud diners near by at the beginning of our meal, nice ambiance. However, you cannot eat the ambiance.

The restaurant was less than half capacity when we arrived, yet as a party of 2 we were seated right in between 2 large groups, one which was loud and distracting. Fortunately the left soon. It was as if they wanted to cram everyone who was there in the same corner.

Service was pleasant, but not as attentive as I expected for the number of patrons present. We had to ask a lot of questions to get basic info, such as specials. We should have been told that up front.

Salads were the most disappointing. Not fresh and not a good seasoning balance. My first salad actually had brown romaine. It was replaced. To make the second one better they overloaded it with toppings. The second one was very salty. It was supposed to be romaine and mixed greens, but it was mostly iceberg, not good.

The two fish entrees were cooked to the perfect consistency, not the least bit dry. However, the halibut is not worth the price and again the salmon was a bit salty.

You can get a better meal and experience just a couple blocks away at Harry & Izzy's. Wish we had gone there. This would be only 2 1/2stars if 1/2stars were an option.
