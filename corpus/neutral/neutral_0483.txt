I'm normally not someone to go to fast food joints being a vegetarian. I have a class near here one night a week and sometimes stop by for a quick take out to hold me over during class since I don't get home until after 9pm. 

Clayton parking sucks but at the time I come here it's usually easy to get a spot right in front. 

The PEOPLE who work here are the high point. They are SO friendly and nice - it really makes a difference. One guy especially is always really nice and seems happy to be working there. 

The burrito can be tailored to your taste, which I like since I'm not a fan of salsa. It is decent and vegetarian friendly. I wish they had queso dip! They have good quality drinks like Nantucket Nectars and Izze. Score!

I'm sure I'll keep coming back for a quick bite.
