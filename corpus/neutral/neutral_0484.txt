While visiting St Petersburg, we were looking for a quick place to grab a bite before heading to the beach. The boardwalk that this place is located on is very charming, with loads of parking (paid, in a garage or on surface, gravel lots). The boardwalk features lots of other restaurants, as well as ice cream shops and beach-wear shops. 

The Boardwalk Grill isn't a large venue, with a few tables outside and a few more tables inside. We vouched to sit outside to enjoy the view of the water. The servers were fairly attentive, but the food took a relatively long time to come out. 

I ordered a grouper sandwich and was not satisfied with taste of it, nor was I satisfied with the fries that came with it. 

Overall, the food wasn't terrible, but neither were the prices. The view was definitely amazing, but I'm sure there are better restaurants elsewhere on the boardwalk.
