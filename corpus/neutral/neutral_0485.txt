So I'm torn between giving the place 3 or 4 stars...so I think I'm going to settle for 3.5 right now.

The Pros: Great staff, fast and efficient service. Authentic. Crazy busy, which should tell people that they are doing something right. The shrimp egg rolls are delicious as is the papaya salad. Would get those two again hands down.

The Cons: The Pho. I ordered my usual pho that I usually order at new places to judge how it compares to other places. While it smells great, how it tastes is a totally different story. It was salty and oily. My beef and sausage were paltry. It was more soup than noodles, and the soup was too salty to really drink. Hours after finishing the meal, I'm still dying of thirst. On a positive note, the cilantro and bean sprouts were super fresh.

The menu is truly extensive and there are really a lot of things on the menu that sound great. It's definitely a crowd-pleaser, given the diverse crowd that was there on Sunday night. I might have to go back and try something else on the menu. Just not the pho.
