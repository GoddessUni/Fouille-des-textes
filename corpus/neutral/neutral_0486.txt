The sauce and toppings bar make this place! Yes the chicken is moist but by itself it's nothing awesome. Same thing with the pork or the ribs. 
The service people are nice but it always seems management is talking with an employee and you need to wait to do a take out order. 
However the sauce and toppings is why I crave this place. The cilantro garlic added to the rice and beans with the jalape√±os and fresh salsa is awesome. Or the spicy poijo bbqsauce for the meat has awesome flavor and just enough heat. 
They also have onions, lime juice, guava bbq sauce and a few others. Delicious add ons
