The Chinese food here in Tampa in general in my opinion is awful almost everywhere however Ho Ho Choy's is actually solid and I really enjoy it. I work nearby and get takeout at least once a week.

They have great "hot chili pepper oil" which always  makes me happy as I usually prefer "the hotter the better". They have very affordable lunch specials for a meal, rice and your choice of soup or spring rolls. My "go to" is the Kung Pao Chicken and Hot & Sour soup...definitely my favorite.

I've never dined inside so I can't speak on their service. They're not the warmest and friendliest of people when I pick food up but the food is pretty solid and other than maybe 1 other place, this is my favorite Chinese food in all of Tampa.
