Good pizza, excellent wings (perhaps another review). I get a pizza to go here about once/twice a week.

Had an annoying experience recently when the staff was misinformed of the daily special. 

About 7pm on a Wednesday: While my son and I order a pizza to go for dinner at the counter, I saw the daily special sign for the Wednesday "10 inch 1 topping pizza for $5". I asked the 'order taker' if this was valid and he responded yes. I then ordered 2 pizza, expecting total to be $10.

When paying at the register, the charge was $18. When questioned, the cashier (not the same person as the 'order taker') went into the back to check with someone (manager?) on the price. He returned, apologized and said the special was only good until 3pm. I informed him the 'order taker' was not aware and told me it was $5 per pie. I paid him the requested $18.

While waiting for the pizza, and seeing no communication among the staff about this minor incident, I went back to the 'order taker' and informed him the offer was only good until 3pm, he looked at me and replied "oh" and went back to work.

I guess I expected more of a response to the whole incident.

Other than that, the staff has always been friendly and polite.
