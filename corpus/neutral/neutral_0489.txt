Dutch Bros, usually one of my favorites, missed the mark for me at this location on my first visit. I ordered, VERY SPECIFICALLY, a white coffee Americano with NO CREAM (because usually if I don't specify, they add it anyway). Imagine my surprise when I pulled away, after the guy repeated my order and specified "no cream," that my Americano STILL was made with milk. Americano = espresso and water. Not cream. I have a dairy intolerance and CANNOT consume dairy, so it was very frustrating to not realize the mistake until I was all the way across town. I will return to this location, because the staff was awesome, but with all the dietary restrictions that people have now-a-days, a slip-up like that could cause some big issues for folks. Please, please PLEASE, pay attention when you're making your coffee drinks for folks who specify certain restrictions.

Food: n/a

Drinks: The quad shot white coffee americano is a kick in the pants! Very strong without the strong coffee flavor, though slighly & naturally nutty. They'd get 5-stars from me if they served drip coffee.

Atmosphere: I like the one-way drive up atmosphere at this location. Two lanes can often make it congested... the one lane makes service super quick.

Service: Fast, easy service. These guys try as hard as they can to move the line through and it's greatly appreciated! You always know that if you see more than a couple cars in line, they'll have someone coming out to your car to take your order so that it's ready as soon as you hit the window.

Happy Hour Offerings: n/a

Healthy Hack: I always order my drinks, even the white coffee, BLACK! (Except, you know, when you order it black and they still add cream). Gah.
