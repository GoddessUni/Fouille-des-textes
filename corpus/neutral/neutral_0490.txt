Eh... We had some amazing food in NO and I have to say, this was the only meal we were not thrilled with. Average shrimp po boy. 
Also, the waitress offered to change the fries to a different side, but I feel she should've mentioned the price difference as well. My bad. Should've asked. 
A table next to the 2 of us, sat after we did, ate before us, and ordered to-go and was out the door when we barely got our food. 
The "free appetizer" with Yelp check in was charged and fixed when we asked. If we hadn't looked, we would've paid. 
I feel the service was slow and below average and food was average. We were sad that it was our last meal in NO. Maybe just a bad day. Everyone has bad days.
