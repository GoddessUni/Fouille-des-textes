I came here on a Saturday night to meet up with some friends. The cover was $10 and the nice lady complemented my hair! 
The band was cool, music was cool and very loud as to be expected. My ears were ringing after I left and we sat up top. 
The crowd downstairs was cool but the people upstairs were...interesting. I wasn't really feeling the band that was playing but it wasn't bad, other people were enjoying it. 
They do serve food here. I got some fries for my friends. It took about 30 min to get them. Over all the vibe was cool. If I went with friends I would go back. If you are into blues music then I would highly suggest it.
