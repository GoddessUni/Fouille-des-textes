I'll start out by saying cake is probably my favorite food in the world and my standards are very high. Their cakes are pretty good although I'm not thrilled that they are not 100% homemade/natural. They have dry mixes shipped to each location and they add the wet ingredients at the bakery. So they do taste a little artificial in my opinion due to the added preservatives/artificial flavorings. My favorites are lemon, white chocolate raspberry, red velvet, and pumpkin. They are pretty moist and the frosting is good.

 I would never get the marble again bc it was dry and tasted exactly like boxed cake mix from the grocery store. I do wish they were more creative with their frosting/cake combos bc they ALL have cream cheese frosting...quite boring. Good cake, but not my favorite.
