Drove to this area for the Farm House Restaurant and it was closed because of the awful tornado the previous night :( Found this spot a block up and it had positive reviews on Yelp, so that is where the adventure started.... Walking inside it has a sports bar feel to it with a texas like design of old doors hanging in the front and a mixed bag of items hanging on the walls for the decor. Dimly lit lots of TVs hanging from above with long neck connecting ceiling fans up above. The massive wall of bottles behind the bar showed off the fancy bottles and large drink menu options. The server was very nice and gave me a slew of recommendations...

After placing my order she started me with the two bite size biscuits which tasted amazing... Small little bites of yumminess. Then I went with a cup of the gumbo and it was just okay. Tasted kind of muddy and the flavor was just okay and no shrimp in it just sausage... For the main course I went with the filet with scallops added and the steak was mediocre but dressed to impress. It just tasted more like a different cut of meat and was not all that flavorful, but would still win the beauty pageant just the cookie show lol...Then the scallops were 5 stars! They were very flavorful and would have been better just getting an order of these. Overall it was a just okay experience but I might venture back to experience just a scallops meal and try some oysters on another visit, but for now this experience left me wishing that my first place was not closed today...
