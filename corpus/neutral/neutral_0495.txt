Went to this new spot at the moorestown mall where distrito used to be, to have brunch before going the movie theater. At first we were told there was an hour wait, then 30 minute wait so we stayed, it was actually 15 minutes before we three were seated at a table for 6, not complaining. Our server, freshly trained, brought beverages quickly. When I ordered avocado toast-the least caloric item on the menu besides oatmeal-he informed me that they were all out of avocados .
Ok, I ordered two eggs no meat with toast and potatoes. My co brunchers both ordered the 'truck driver' platter which is eggs, potatoes or meat, and a huge pancake. Other food that went by our table was also oversized and stacked-up fried things. The food was just ok, would have rather gone to a diner tbh, the atmosphere is pretty clunky, the tv had an infomercial for bathroom cleaning tools going the whole time, just kind of disjointed. Not sure it's going to resonate in this demographic. Overheard a man at the next table being informed that they were 'all out' of espresso drinks, at 10:30am? It was a one and done for us.
