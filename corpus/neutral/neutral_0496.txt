Nice sandwiches.  Excellent service.  Decent pricing.  3.5 stars.

While this is not my favorite Jewish deli, they do make a solid corned beef reuben sandwich, along with pastrami on pumpernickel.  The reuben had a good amount of kraut and Russian dressing that wasn't drenching the bread accompanying the moist, thin sliced corned beef.  Paired out with a nice Swiss cheese and it was delicious.  The pastrami was a fairly plain sandwich but had a gratuitous amount of meat for $6 and tasted nice.  The cheesesteak was average though the bread left a bit to be desired.

On the service side, food came out very quickly (though we were there at 4PM and there wasn't much else going on), our waitress was very pleasant, and had no qualms grabbing me a slushie from the attached grocery store instead of one of the menu drinks.  Oh, and if you're feeling it, they've got a lot of beer options for you.

Solid Reuben.  200? different bottles of beer available.  Good service.  Not bad if you're in that area.
