THE VERDANT VERANDA COFFEE SHOP at Nashville and Magazine;
NEVER QUITE GOTTEN a clear vibe here, but it's a good #2 if your cafe's too busy;
SQUIRREL!!! dog friendly with grass and shade trees.

There are so many coffee shops on Magazine, many with different distinctive personalities.  For me though, Luna is less about élan. This is the café you go to if you want to sit out on that beautiful veranda on a pretty day.  Or if you want a comfortable substitute when your favorite place is packed-in.  I'm sure Luna has some "regulars", but for me, I'm glad it's here as a go-to alternative.
