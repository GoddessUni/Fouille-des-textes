I really dug the night atmosphere here, with the outdoor seating w/ heaters. Indoors kept the great feel of an underground, trendy joint.

The area we sat (corner) had some uncomfortable seating arrangements, and I was like "Do I lean over, do I lean back? What's my motivation here? How does this seat work?" This all to say, after a couple of cocktails I knew exactly how to sit/lean.

The unfortunate part of this visit was that our waitress didn't know how to make a few drinks - which I would find is OK generally, but don't lie about knowing what a Burnt Martini is if you don't know. Just ask, and they'll usually tell you exactly how to make it. Easy.

Outside of that, and the cost of the drinks I would find this place to be a great 4 - 6 person cocktail place for special occasions. Date night for married couples with kids, maybe not so much.
