Bottom line up front: A good burger, but not worth the wait, and it smells like a locker room. 

We waited for an hour at 3:30pm for a table.  I'm glad we were seated in the back area, because the stuffy bar area was dark, crowded, and smelled awful.  It was unappetizing to say the least.  The menu is tiny, basically if you're not here for the burger, go elsewhere.  The baked potato is surpringinly good. 

For the burger, it was ordered medium and came served as order.  This fat, thick patty is served on a small bun, achieving a great meat to bun ratio.  No option for cheese on the burger, only shredded low quality cheddar.  The burger is quite good, but I have a hard time believing it is even the best in the city.

For drinks, cheap small selection of craft and domestics, 3-4 choices of each.  The monsoon is the drink of choice for nearly everyone.  This $10 Hi-C flavored cocktails contains almost a comical amount of rum.
