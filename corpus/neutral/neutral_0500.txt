Went to the 504ward Holiday Party here last night, and it's an awesome place to host an event as far as I could tell. 504ward events are always worthwhile, and for $20 there was beer/wine, soft drinks and a specialty cocktail at one of the two private bars set up, plus all kinds of food served buffet style as well as passed by servers. The event was upstairs, and 200 people took over that entire space comfortably. It was full but not crowded and made for a great vibe overall. 

Obviously, this place is on Bourbon Street, which is not my favorite thing in the world. It would've been more inconvenient if I'd decided to drive my car instead of cab over, I imagine. My only minor complaint was that when I got home after slightly more than an hour at this party, I smelled of some kind of food, as though I'd been in the kitchen rather than upstairs at a special event. 

No idea what dinner and so forth is like at Bourbon House, but if you're looking for a venue to plan an event, this is definitely one of many great options around the city.
