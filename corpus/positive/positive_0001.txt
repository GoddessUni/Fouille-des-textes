Great Place--it is about time that the Southwest County area get a great BBQ place. My husband loves Pappy's and this is even better because it is closer! The ribs were amazing, fire and ice fried pickles were really good and dip that went with them really made them even better! Sweet potato fries were really good and so was the pulled chicken sandwich. There was a line most of the time that we were there, but it moved fast. The workers/servers were friendly and helpful. The manager was welcoming and answered all of our questions about menu items. Great find!
