The only thing formal about Galatoire's is the requirement that men wear jackets.  After that, get ready for a great time.

The waiters are social.  The diners are chatty and fun.  The tile floor and lack of any carpeting anywhere means the dining room (at least the downstairs one--I won't sit upstairs) gets really loud.  And if you have half a social bone in your body, you will end up being friends (if only for an hour or so) with the folks around you or with the very nicely dressed and probably very wealthy man who drank too much and who is making the rounds and moving from table to table. 

Go with the seafood dishes and the cream sauces and such.  I had soft shell crab covered with fresh lump crab.  Overindulgence?  You bet.  And it was great.

An appetizer, soup and salad, two entrees, one dessert, and three cocktails, plus tax and tip, ran about $150.  You might pay double that in stuffier joints where you won't have half the fun.

Indeed, I'm a fan.
