This place was a life saver after the fiasco we had at a fast food chain a block or so up. So glad we found it when we did. 
It was late, we were starving, and had just been treated awful at another place. 
The line here was long, but we decided to wait it out instead of search for somewhere else. 
They got us in and our pretty quickly. All of our food was correct and so good. And the staff was a breath of fresh air after dealing with the staff down the road. They were friendly and courteous, despite how busy they were, and made sure we were good to go before sending us off.
