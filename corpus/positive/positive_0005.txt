The menu has something for everyone and the beer list is impressive!  They offer you 2 1-oz. pours on the house, so I was excited to try a few craft beers on tap.  For dinner, I ordered the BBQ Chicken Salad and it was SO DELICIOUS!  I also shared the french fries with my Mom (who ordered a burger and said it was delicious), and the waitress brought out several different types of BBQ sauces, which were quite tasty.  We also ordered a Blackened Chicken Torta sandwich for takeout & my husband said it was one of the best sandwiches he has ever eaten.  Can't wait to eat here again!
