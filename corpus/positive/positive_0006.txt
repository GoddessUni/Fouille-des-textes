I've been going to be well at least 3 times a week for the last three years. It is the perfect place, atmosphere, and cozy spot for people looking to get out of the house or grab a bite to eat. You can tell that everybody cares about each other that works here. The food is incredible. There aren't many places like be well in bucks county. From smoothies to wraps, salads, AMAZING desserts, and soups and more. If I had to choose some favorites it would be the bright eyes smoothie with spinach, veggie soup, butternut bean burrito, açaí bowl, mocha espresso, and mocha/salted caramel tuxedo cups. I love this place.
