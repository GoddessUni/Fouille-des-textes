The Whistling Kettle is one of those places that has been around forever but flies completely under the radar. No social media that I can find, but #iykyk. 

Old school diner with a simple, small menu full of #yegcheapeats. It's dated and sparsely decorated, but the coffee is kept topped up and the food is fast and delicious. Run by the sweetest Asian family, this local spot has both breakfast and lunch options.

They were busier before covid, so they can use the extra love and support. If you're looking for an old school greasy-spoon diner on the North, give them a try!
