Stopped in this place last night to check it out. It's located in the old Criallo's spot. It has nice ambience especially after a hectic week. We were seated quickly in a booth and our waiter was knowledgeable and super friendly. I ordered the chicken piccata. It was delicious. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the pasta was fresh. After dinner, the owner stopped by our table to thank us for coming in. He shared a little about the restaurants philosophy of never frozen and fresh products. It was an enjoyable evening. I will definitely be back. This may be my new "go-to".
