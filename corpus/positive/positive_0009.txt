Star #1 for Real (not paper) cups and mugs
Star #2 for Greek-infused pastries and lunch specials
Star #3 for Nice corner spot with natural light and no parking meters
Star #4 for Big foamy lattes
Star #5 for Not pretending to be something you're not (such free office space, or carefully focus grouped, or unaffected by the cost of accepting credit cards)

Overall: Cute, cozy corner coffee shop with variety and character. Not trying to compete with corporate american coffee, just doing its own thing the best it can and I like it.

Support local businesses because they are never perfect. This means they're human.
