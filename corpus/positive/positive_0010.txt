Took the plunge and decided to try something new and adventurous before a beer festival today. I needed food that was satisfying and would serve as a good beer sponge. Went on Yelp while visiting the Humane Society of Tampa Bay and found West Tampa Sandwich Shop. I had seen this place on the news before and it has been described as a hole in the wall. I'm a MAJOR fan after testing this!! Amazing honey cuban sandwich!!! Make sure you take a trip here!!

The parking is limited and the shop is tiny. It has about 10 tables and a diner style bar to sit at. You can order your food to go, which I saw many people do while I was there. It is divey, but well established and very clean. I am in love with this place.

Food is incredibly priced. I got the Honey Cuban "Obama Sandwich" and the Yuca Frita. OMG so good!!! I got the large sandwich for $4.95 and the Yuca was $2.50. So much food!! Many people were ordering empanadas for $2.50. This place is a gem. GO! I am posting the menu so you can see the value...everything looked amazing and I will definitely go back.
