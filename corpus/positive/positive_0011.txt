Excellent Poki! Wow I am so impressed. I am so glad this place exists in Nashville now, because I have been craving Poki for a year since returning from Hawaii! I will say though that The Poki isn't traditional Hawaiian Poki but it definitely tastes close enough and a very good adaptation of it! You get to choose from regular or large bowels, fish, toppings, sauces, and garnishes. They also have signature bowls if you are too lazy to pick out something good yourself! The customer service was excellent and they take their time explaining everything to you! Price is steep but Poki has a lot of expensive ingredients so it's worth it!
