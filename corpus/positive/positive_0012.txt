Excellent place to go and have an awesome Italian meal. Best part? Its BYOB (and you won't have to worry about cork fees like certain other places have started doing in philly). We were here with a big group and they were really accommodating. For my entr√©e I got the salmon with the potatoes and it was fresh and yummy. Everyone else at the table seemed to be enjoying their food as well. I also had a taste of the truffle pasta that my friend got and I highly recommend it if you want a vegetarian dish. The truffle tasted delicious and it wasn't too overpowering. Good place for large groups or a date night.
