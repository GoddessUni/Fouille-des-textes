We went as a church group, the food was very good and already planned what we would have, it is pricey place to eat, staff was nice the only part that was a disappointment, we all were given cheesecake at the end we had five couples at our table, we received one large piece of cheesecake which we cut into at the table to share with our spouse, some of us had to wait on our cheesecake till the point that others were all done eating theirs.  Since this event was scheduled way in advance, this was something that should have been prevented.
Over all serve and food was awesome, would go again. The place is beautiful decorated and valet parking.  I was very impressed for my first time. there was 64 total in our room, so it was a fun time.
