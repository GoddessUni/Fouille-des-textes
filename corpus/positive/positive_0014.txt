Food was great. Service was on point. The bartender, a young blonde girl, was top of the line. Every drink in the restaurant was being made by her--each with care, craft, and quickness. She not only maintained composure but also she smiled every time eye contact was made with a customer. We ordered the two specialty cocktails with bourbon--both tasted amazing. Having worked in the industry for over 15 years, I was extremely impressed with everything she brought to the experience. I usually don't give the highest rating possible to a place because, as a teacher I feel there is always room for improvement. However, the bartender's work ethic and the product she put out inspired the bonus so Zasu gets 5 stars.
Food was so exceptional that I can think of only a few restaurants that can compete as contenders. We ordered the mahi mahi and saltine crusted grouper. 
It's also pretty cool the way the light outside of the front door shines through casting a shadow of the 127 address number on the dining rooms far wall. 
I highly recommend this place.
