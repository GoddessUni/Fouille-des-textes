Norristown to the northwest of Philadelphia has its own food specialties and it is indeed the land of fried bologna sandwiches and zeps. One of the best places to try one of these foods is the venerable Lou's Luncheonette right on Main street.  The interior - especially the wavy counter - looks cool .... like something from a bygone era.  And then there are the zeps. A zep is kinda like a hoagie but it has only one thick cut meat in it and it doesn't have lettuce. There are several different types of zeps. It is def tasty and there is a hot peppers sauce on the counter to add to it.  During the week, Lou's closes at 3 pm (later on the weekends) so make sure if you wanna eat a zep that you don't wait until after work!
