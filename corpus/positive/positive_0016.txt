In town visiting and wanted good quality and healthy food.  Enter: Leafy Greens Cafe. 

Alright so, I was a pretty strict vegetarian for like 15 years, but not so much anymore.  Well, not at all anymore.  And, even with my propensity to enter vegetarian/vegan establishments, I was still a little frightened by the menu - pretty extreme! 

However, boom! I was really shocked at how amazing everything was!  

I had "The Real Deal" and was totally skeptical of the "Raw Onion Bread."  But it was sooooo tasty that I couldn't have imagined the dish without it.  Also, it was only $11, which is crazy cheap considering the high quality ingredients.  I recommend this dish to anyone! 

I will go back next time I'm visiting St. Pete and have already recommended it to a bunch of people!
