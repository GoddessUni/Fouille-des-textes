So, if you've ever had this shop's counterpoint, Pinkberry, this may be a disappointment. This new frozen yogurt craze honestly has me pretty excited. I've had Pinkberry, and sure, there are quite a few differences, and Pinkberry IS better, but I fell in love with Fro-Yo. 

I was so excited, mostly because we had nothing like it only months ago.

It's all self service, so that's pretty cool, though I felt like I was back in the dorms. You pay by the ounce which sounds pretty great, but it can end up being expensive when you're not paying attention to your portions. The toppings are self serve too which is a pleasant surprise. Though the toppings aren't extremely fresh, they do have a good variety of fruits, candies, and granola. 

Fro-Yo has quite a few flavors, but I only had the original tart (fantastic!) and I had a sample of the New York Cheesecake. That was definitely one I'll go back for.

I reserved my last star even though I loved it for a few reasons. 
- The only reason I knew I could get a sample was because I read a few Yelp reviews mentioning it. They weren't visible, and the guy at the counter almost seemed annoyed I asked.
- Brings me to my second point being that the guy at the counter REALLY didn't seem to care that he was employed. Not that it really mattered to me because I literally only needed him to check me out. However, I asked about one of the toppings and he didn't even know what it was! Useless! Honestly, they could probably replace his position with a self checkout like the grocery store. 
- My last reason for that last star? It's NOT Pinkberry.....but the taste is damn close!
