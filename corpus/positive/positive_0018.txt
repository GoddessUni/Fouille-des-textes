Delicious but expensive. 

My boyfriend and I ventured over here one lazy Saturday night. There were only two other tables sat so I was a little nervous, but decided to try it out. We ordered some veggie samosas to start with, and they came out piping hot with a spicy dipping sauce. Very obviously home-made.

We decided on the Butter Chicken and Lamb Saag and my gooodnesss!!! They were probably the best Indian dishes I've ever had. At first, the plates looked a bit small but I realized that's because they are packed with flavor and spice! The sauces were just delicious and the meat was so tender and juicy. They were served with fluffy white rice which absorbed all of the yummy sauce, I'm actually salivating while writing this review.

The only reason for deducting one star was because of the price. The naan was crispy rather than doughy which I'm used to, but it was still tasty. I asked the waitress for more and I come to find out that we were charged an extra $4 for an additional naan! 

For just the two of us, it cost $50, yowzza! But even still, it was so delicious that I will go back regardless. Yummy!
