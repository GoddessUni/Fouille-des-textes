New taco truck on Milpas open at the Prestige car wash lot in the evenings after the car wash closes. 

Fresh made tortillas and three tacos for $5 pulled me in while walking down Milpas street. Other items in the menu included tortas, gorditas and other standard taco truck fare but we went for the tacos, trying chicken, rajas con queso, barbacoa, chicharrones, and al pastor.  

They were all fantastic. My only complaint was that I neglected to order more of them. The chicken was cooked perfectly without being dry. It paired well with the pico de gallo available at the truck.  The rajas con queso had a perfect amount of cheese without getting too greasy. My taco al pastor had well seasoned pork that was not overcooked, as us often the case when I order the same elsewhere. The barbacoa was perhaps the standout, although only bu the slimmest of margins, as it had a perfect blend of flavor and tang. It was a bit messy though, but this is finger food. The chicharrones, a personal favorite order of mine at any taco establishment was a welcome mouthful of fat and flavor but it definitely yearned for the pico de gallo to help balance out the textures. 

They have two small portable tables they set up for those wishing to eat immediately. At 7:15, just as they were finishing opening up for the night, the area was just starting to get crowded, and is definitely a welcome addition to the Milpas neighborhood. 

I've seen them only here in the evenings on most nights but Monday. Somebody tell me if they ever set up elsewhere.
