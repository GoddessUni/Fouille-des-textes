Met the cofounder, Ralph Rubio, who is a very nice and informative guy. The staff is super pleasant. This location is super clean. There is indoor and outside seating.

I tried the Oaxacan Shrimp Bowl and the Oaxacan Shrimp Taco... amazing. The shrimp have nice grill marks and seemed super fresh. The tacos are street style, so they are the size of your palm, which is perfect so you can indulge in plenty! 

The oaxacan shrimp taco consist of cotija cheese, oaxacan sauce(loved it), guac, cilantro, & onions.

The bowl had shrimp, oaxacan sauce, black beans and rice, guac, pico de gallo, romain lettuce strips, and tortilla chips.

The guac, unlike some other places, is for no extra charge on most dishes here.

A plus is that Rubio's has a reward system, so download the app!
