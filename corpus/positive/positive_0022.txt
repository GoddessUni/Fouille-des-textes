We made reservations online on Opentable for my birthday on February 13th. We got there and the hostess couldn't find our reservation. She asked us if we made reservation for the right restaurant. Um....yes I did. Then she asked us if we made reservation for the right city. Um..yeah I'm pretty sure I made it for Philadelphia. I had to show her my reservation on my phone. After that, we got seated after 5 minutes. Our waitress was really nice. The steak that we ordered was perfect. Perfect. Perfect. It had so much flavor. We also ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and it was honestly to die for. I got a little birthday cake, which was cute. Afterwards we walked to the bathroom in the downstairs area and took photos since the restaurant useto be an old bank. Then we chilled at the bar and ordered drinks. Their cocktails were delicious. I enjoyed everything from the moment we sat down to start our dinner. The hostess that night made me take a star away. I definitely made reservations and would not lie about it. And don't ask me if I made it for the right city. I'm definitely not an idiot. Other then that I had a great time here.
