Melograno absolutely wins restaurant week. 

This BYO is tucked into Samson street, not far from village whiskey.  The restaurant week menu had almost as many options as their normal menu. 

I started with a Pinsa (fun fact: That's the Latin word for Pizza) that had the best mozzarella I've ever eaten, continued onto the Shrimp and Fennel Risotto. (HOW did they infuse the risotto with that amazing goat cheese taste?!) and finished out the night with tiramisu. 

All of those items are on their normal menu and I highly recommend you go try them.

It is pretty loud, and if you're dining as a couple, you'll probably be stuck in one of those annoying close seating situations but it's not the worst.
