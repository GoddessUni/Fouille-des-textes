Im giving this place straight up 5 stars because the food was EXCELLENT, the service was very good, and I enjoyed the atmosphere very much, reminded me of Portland, and sure enough, one of the guys working there is from Portland and they were shooting for that sort of atmosphere. Long Picnic tables outside, corn hole set up, very urban and fun. I highly recommend it, and it's only been here since 2015! The beer is also good, all brewed in-house. 
As for the food, it was delicious. They have a nicely rounded menu full of southern comfort style meals. Lena and I had the shrimp and grits, which was probably my second time ever having this dish, very very tasty. We also had fried chicken-some of the best I've had, as well as mashed potatoes and gravy and collard greens-also one of my favorite southern dishes. They even had pepper and garlic infused vinegar on the table to compliment the food. I'll just say, you gotta try it. Price is not bad either. If you "check-in" on yelp you get a free 5oz pour of beer. There is really no reason not to give this place a shot!!
