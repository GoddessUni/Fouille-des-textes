Soft opening right now so not all their menu items have rolled out. Came to catch up with a friend and a pretty laid back atmosphere. Lots of TV's to watch March Madness and definitely nice that you don't have to yell to hear anything as opposed to many other bars in the area. 

Food was pretty good. They didn't have the sandwiches rolled out so friend and I tried the pizzas. Pretty darn tasty. Crust had a nice char and was crispy. I just wish the egg on top was runny. Completely cooked yolks aren't quite as nomworthy esp on a pizza. I liked how overall the menu wasn't overwhelming with too many choices. 

Service was the best I've had in recent memory. Our waitress was attentive and knew the menu well. She checked up with us often without being overwhelming.
