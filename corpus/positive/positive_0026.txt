I  had the thin sliced brisket with the blue cheese cole slaw on New Years Eve (see picture) and it was delicious. I like that you can just order it and they will deliver it right to you at Courtyard Brewery. A bunch of us ordered BBQ and it really put our little New Years Eve party over the top. Damien says that he slow cooks the meat and you can definitely tell. It's melt in your mouth delicious with a lot of flavor and not chewy at all.

Right now, Black Label is only a popup inside of Barrel Proof, but I am hoping that they have an actual store front soon.
