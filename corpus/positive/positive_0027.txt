I have been to all the cupcake places in town. I love their strawberry champagne cupcakes, but they aren't always there since they rotate the flavors. Part of the reason I like them is that their icing isn't so heavy, you'd end up with a tummy ache after two bites. The cakes are always moist. The only sad thing is it's sort of hidden next to Bluefin across the courtyard from the Frogs French Bistro. If you are in the Casas Adobles shopping center having Wildflower, Blue Fin or Sauce, head over and get a little something to end the meal just right. The top seller is their red velvet cupcake; very light moist cake and not too sweet or too rich...just right for me! They have two sizes options, so there is a  "mini" size and a standard size, so I think anyone can get just the right amount. 

Plus, if you are walking your dog in the area, they sell peanut butter dog treats.
