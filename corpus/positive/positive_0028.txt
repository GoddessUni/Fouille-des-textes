This is a very nice dining restaurant. The staff was very courteous and funny, although I wish they would've wore professional uniforms/server outfits. Our waiter just had on jeans and a shirt, but very nice. The food was great, I ordered the shrimp and grits which was very flavorful. The other girls ordered meat and chicken, and it all looked good as well. The bread was very fresh and came with a good butter option. I tried the creme brûlée and wow! Very good. I would go back, but I would get meat if I go back or something else since my shrimp wasn't my favorite, but nonetheless, it was a good experience!
