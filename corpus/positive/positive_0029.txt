My wife and I went here for brunch.  I ordered the scrambled eggs with bacon, potatoes, and white toast.  She ordered one of the specials, which was a crab cake/egg/bacon thing on toast.  The crab cake thing she ordered was AMAZING! My wife is from Maryland, so she's picky about crab cakes.  She loved it! It also had a delicious aioli on it, which I stole a little bit of to eat with my eggs. I would go back just for that crabcake thing.  

I gave this review 4 stars out of 5.  While my wife's dish was amazing, mine was so-so.  One of my toast pieces was burned.  My eggs were average.  The potatoes were really good and the bacon was cooked the way I asked (extra crispy).  

Service was good.
