Seriously impressed with this place.  I've only been once, so I can't give it 5 stars yet but the food, BBQ pork sliders served with slaw on top, exceeded my expectations so I will definitely be back.  The service was fantastic as well.  The gentleman behind the counter took the time to explain how they operate and what they had to offer.  The fresh baked bread is quite delish and also available at the GBCFC.  They get their meat from local farms (WOOHOO!) AND they have homemade pasta in the grab and go section.  
The menu is, imho, comfort food at it's finest.  They even have a meatloaf sandwich.  Did I mention the chocolate chip cookie?  Get one, you won't be disappointed.  
Oh AND there's a full bar with buy 1 get 1 Bloody Mary's and Mimosas on Sunday.  I will definitely be back.
I discovered last night that they sell their amaze balls chocolate chip cookies in Pilsbury-style dough form.  Well I headed straight home to make some cookies and let me tell you what!  They tasted just like the ones cooked at Reno Provisions.  Shut the front door! Color this girl happy and consider her a regular.
