Went here after seeing clipper cash in clipper magazine.  Went on a bbq frenzy and ordered a ton of food for 2 of us.  Shared brisket sandwich which was fantastic!  also a side of baked beans-nice and sweet the way i like them.   then moved on to the sampler platter.  will say the chicken and pulled pork were a little dry but i do like them like that.  Boyfriend doesnt and said that is only thing they could do better.  with it had corn muffin which was average, mac  and cheese, and potato salad.
mac and cheese was really good.  could use some salt but i like alot of salt.  potato salad was good.   a nice onion taste.  Could use a little less celery but that is just me. Slaw is really good and i hate slaw.  nice and sweet.  totally homemade.   The platter also had ribs which were outstanding.  Best i have had in a while and i went ribbing around Memphis.  The food was better than most in Memphis!   also have a littel sauce bar where you can put it in containers yourself and mark with the lids whcih is nice.   We will be back for sure!
