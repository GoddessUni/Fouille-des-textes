We had lunch here today.  We had tried this place some decade ago, and were not impressed.  But recent great Yelp reviews brought us in for "Caldo de Res", Mexican style beef & vegetable soup. 

Unlike prior visits, everything was good, to very good today.  

The servings of caldo and beef were enormous; had we known, we'd have split one.

The usual chips, salsa, etc were OK.

Seems that something here has happened to improve the food, service, and appearance of the place.

This will be back on our "to visit" list, as we saw some other offerings that looked very good, too.

Stay tuned,
Rick
