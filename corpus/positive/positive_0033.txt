Simply marvelous. I try to eat here at least once a month with friends. It's moderately priced and only semi-upscale. My friends and I can go out for a casual lunch with appetizers such as the miso or wanton soups, egg/spring rolls, and the delectable Angry Crab raggoon. I've also had wonderful dates here, the sushi is fresh and full of clean flavors. The Pad Thai is the best on the east coast in my opinion (I've tried it everywhere), and the other dishes are presented wonderfully and tastefully. It perfect for any affair. (BYOB)

Also, my close friend had her wedding catered by Mandarin Oriental and no quality was lost in the presentation or taste (and this was an outdoor wedding about a 1/2 hour away from their restaurant) It was professional and classy, perfect for the large wedding.
