One of my best friends gave out Taste of Nashville giftbags to her wedding guests and Blushing Berry Chocolates made the cut (Nolensville, technically).  There was an adorable 2"x2" gift box with 4 of Blushing Berries Truffles.

We had the pleasure of tasting the Raspberry Truffle, Salted Caramel Truffle, Bourbon Pecan Truffle, and the Hazlenut Truffle.

My favorites were the Salted Caramel (winner, winner, chicken dinner) and the Raspberry Truffle.  For me, the Raspberry would be a star if the center were a delightful raspberry puree and not a puree mixed in with ganache.  The Bourbon Pecan was nice and a good tie nearly with the Raspberry.  Last, was the Hazelnut.  I love hazelnut, but maybe my preference for this one had more to do with it being a milk chocolate truffle and I'm a dark chocolate lover.  All in all, very nice chocolates.  I could buy the Salted Caramel in bulk.

Looking at the website, I'd love to get the Amaretto, Espresso, and Vanilla Cream Truffles.  Hopefully, I can pop in the shop soon.
