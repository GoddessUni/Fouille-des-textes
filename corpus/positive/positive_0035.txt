Came in to grab some breakfast and use the coupon we had earned through their Egghead club.  I'm not a fan for how they make their omelets, so I opted for the scrambled version of Dierdoni without the mushrooms (sausage, bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, and jack cheese).  My hubby ordered the scrambled version of My Big Fat Greek Omelette.  My food didn't have anything wrong with it, but it didn't quite hit the spot I was hoping for.  

It seems that we almost always get greeted with a smile.  We declined the first table offered to us because we prefer to sit across from each other versus side by side.  Another table was readily available quite promptly.  Our server was ok; nothing in his service stood out, but I don't have any complaints either.  The food was delivered with good presentation, good temps, and good taste.  A waitress scooped up my check and cc before I was ready to take it to the front register, and returned it processed and ready to sign.  All in all, it was a good meal.
