Definitely one of my favorite cheesesteak places out here. We did a late night run and ran into the after-game (Phillies vs. Padres) crowd. While the line was long, it was nothing compared to the monstrosity that faces you when you arrive at Pat's & Geno's! I love late-night cheesesteak.

The steaks (wiz and onions) were HUGE. If I wasn't so hungry, I wouldn't have been able to finish it on my own. The fries were a little lackluster (curly fries with cheese); I like Geno's freedom fries better.

While the location is ghetto (I'm talkin' like, the outside smells like straight up trash), the food is good and filling. You'll definitely get your broad spectrum of clientele there-- there was a table of three 10-year-old boys next to us looking through the naked lady ads in the paper and rating the models' boobs! (O_o) Oh, South Philly, you never disappoint.
