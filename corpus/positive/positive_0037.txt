Service at this place was truly top notch. I mean they didn't rush to be friendly when I walked in but eventually it got better. I guess I'm not too picky! Seriously though the waiter was incredible and obviously local because he seemed to know about everything. I don't think I've had an individual experience with a server in my time in Santa Barbara so this is very refreshing. 

Sushi was good, like good, not unforgettable. The half-off thing helps bring a lot of value to the sushi, you definitely feel like you get your money's worth unlike a lot of sushi restaurants here. 

Bathroom is pretty decent, I don't know why I feel like this should be included but I saw someone else complain about it being dirty. There was a guy doing his hair or something though...strange.

Something's Fishy is really a terrible name in my opinion but the restaurant is good!
