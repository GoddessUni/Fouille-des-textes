Tonight was my first time trying blaze since being at temple and I have nothing bad to say about it!! It reminded me exactly of a MOD pizza, I didn't see much of a difference with it. I ordered the red vine (I think?) which was the closest thing on the menu to a margherita Pizza and I just added ricotta cheese. The pizza was delicious, it came fresh out of the oven and it was cooked to the perfect temperature. 
I saw that blaze offers rewards and you get a stamp for each pizza you purchase, when you get to 10 then your pizza is free. Pretty cool, I'm going to check it out!
