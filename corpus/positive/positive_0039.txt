I love this place now more than ever because if their delivery service. When I either go in person or get food delivered to my house I normally purchase seafood. Their mussels are very succulent and well flavored.  Yesterday I placed an order for the broiled seafood combo which came with a crab cake, 3 large shrimps,  a salmon a choice of a salad or soup which I got the soup if the day which was Italian wedding,  with two sidings which I chose mash potatoes and spinach for only $18.50 very delicious,  but I do have to admit their salmon us always dried but ate it anyway,  too hungry to pass up but could need more tendering with and the delivery charge was $1.00 which is good enough for me than having to go the distance to go over there is very convenient.  Will be ordering as long as they continue to deliver!
