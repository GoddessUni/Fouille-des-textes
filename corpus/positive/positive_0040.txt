I've been looking to try The Funky Taco Love for a few months and finally had the chance last night.  I'm writing this while eating the leftovers because there were way too many good things to pass up on the menu.

I love the multiple vegan options! The cauliflower appetizer was seasoned and fried well, the dipping sauce was great, and other than needing a little hot sauce, there was nothing slowing us down from finishing it with our drinks. The cauliflower tacos were very similar to the appetizer but in a saucy taco form. The tofu bahn mi tacos were super fresh and a very refreshing take on a tofu taco. Lastly, the vegan enchiladas with creamed corn was a solid entree with lots of flavor and creamy goodness. 

The staff was helpful and the requisite amount of funky cool.  Can't wait to bring people here to try more things on the menu!
