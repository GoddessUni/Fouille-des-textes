We just moved here from Alabama about 3 weeks ago and out of 4 different pizza places we've tried Marinos is by far the BEST!!!! The owners/staff were so welcoming and helpful. The hubby and I got a small pizza to split, my half roasted red peppers and spinach, his half spinach and mushroom. The crust was so crispy and light and the sauce.. OMG sooooo good!!!!!! This is definitely the best pizza I've ever had and is our new go to spot. 
They serve hoagies, fries, chew stakes and more but with how good the pizza was it'll definitely be a difficult choice next time we visit
