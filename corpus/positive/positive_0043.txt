My boyfriend and I LOVE Cactus Club. The West Edmonton Mall location was our go-to dinner/drink place before the Jasper Ave location opened up. Both places are great for the summer with their awesome patios, but Jasper Ave has a patio fully enclosed with glass, so that you can still enjoy the patio, sunny type feel, even in the winter!

If you haven't before, try the butternut squash ravioli. Usually when we go with 2-4 people, we get a plate of the full size order (7 pieces) for an appetizer, which ends up being a better deal for the price. For drinks, their Red Sangria is amazing! But, pretty much all of their listed drinks are... My boyfriend loves the Cohiba. 

Cactus Club is a bit more expensive than other dining places in the area, but 100% worth it. By far one of the best places to eat in Edmonton!! Go there expecting to drink lots.
