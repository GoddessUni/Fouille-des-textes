Why didn't we try this place all this while despite having passed it a couple of hundred times on Lincoln Hwy? Steve's makes a seriously good cheese steak that it could easily be called "King of Steaks".

We got caramelized onions on both our orders. I went with Provolone and I convinced my wife to get the cheese wiz. The hot sauce and the array of peppers in the self serve bar are the perfect condiments to go on this meaty creation. We also got the hot and spicy fries which were pretty crisp and had a seasoning akin to a spicier old bay. The combo hit our grease spot dead center. 

The cheese wiz proved a bit too heavy for my wife but she demolished the entire sandwich nevertheless. She said that she'd definitely go with regular cheese the next time we are here.
