I visited Ambrosia for the first time this weekend and decided to bring the whole family along. We made a reservation online a few days before, very convenient! I called to make sure they allowed children and was delighted to know that not only do they, but they pride themselves on being family owned and operated for generations. Due to my initial question regarding children, the individual who answered the phone made it a point to come to our table on the night of our dinner and welcome the little one in our group! It was a very thoughtful gesture. (We did not ask for a children's menu, and I did not see one, but every member of our group had leftover food and we ordered plenty of appetizers - so we were able to share everything). 

My favorite starter by far was the pulpo - grilled octopus. Normally this is my husband's favorite and it's tough to prepare. Ambrosia hit it out of the park with beautiful presentation, great flavor, and wonderful texture. For the meal, I ordered the gnocchi with mushrooms. This was exactly what I thought of when I ordered - creamy, well served, and deliciously covered in mushrooms. I would order this again and again. The rest of the group was equally pleased with their selections: Veal Marsala, Gambiero (shrimp pasta), and Ravioli Alla Mama (cheese & spinach ravioli with pesto cream sauce).

Be sure to ask for a wine and/or cocktail menu as well as the dessert menu! Overall, fantastic service and delicious food. I hope to be there again soon!
