One of my favorite casual places on St. Pete Beach for food, fun, drinks, live music and an incredible view.

The dishes here are tasty and not bad in price. Our table had fish, chicken and shrimp tacos. As other reviewers shared, the "Wholly guacamole" is in an individually packaged cup, not made fresh, but was still delicious on the tacos.

The vodka lemonade drink special, with strawberries was tasty but, wow...really strong! Maybe it was because I hadn't eaten yet, but one drink went straight to my head. Good thing I had a mile walk back to my hotel to "sweat it out!"

I loved the acoustic guitar music and relaxed atmosphere here. We were seated just in time to see a wedding on the beach on a beautiful day with clear blue skies.
