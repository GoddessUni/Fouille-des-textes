Last minute restaurant week reservation for a big party of 7. The name itself seems casual, which this place was. However, their food could have been served in a fancier restaurant. True to the Cafe in their name, they offered an assortment of sandwiches. 

Four people did restaurant week and enjoyed the goat cheese salads, trout, escargot and chocolate cake. The onion soup was very good, and everyone raved about the beef and the lamb, saying they were perfectly cooked. The roasted chicken sandwich was quite delicious with pesto and a solid chunk of cheese, in addition to the very good bread.

The service was a little disjointed (plates coming out at different times, silverware not being replaced when there was food in front of everyone, bread coming out after the entrees), which I attribute to not everyone getting restaurant week menu items and having such a large party.

I would come back here for lunch to get a sandwich but probably not dinner again. It was pretty noisy and more casual than I'm used to for dinner dates.
