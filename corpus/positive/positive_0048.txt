This was well worth the wait! We went on a Sunday morning right before noon. It was busy several parties already waiting so it turned into a 45 minute wait for 2 party table. I was starving! We found a bench to sit and they text you to advise to start heading to the restaurant. We ordered coffee and juice. Fried green tomatoes starter. It was topped with lettuce, tomatoes, candied bacon and fried well. A little crunchier than I preferred but the flavors together were phenomenal. I had a medium burger topped with over medium egg, dressed with trimmings. I did it was huge I only finished 1/2. I did not get a decent pic but it was delish, the fries are shoestring and we're not greasy or salty they were crisp and just the right temperature. My guest had the BYO omelet with spinach, shrimp, and ham, grits and a biscuit and he did not take long to devour the plate! The service was great, and quick once inside. The restaurant itself was clean and very well decorated, with TVs in all views. The football game was playing. I look forward to returning and trying more breakfast. I like to eat breakfast early am or late after midnight.
