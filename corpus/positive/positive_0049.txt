Last weekend my family and I ventured to our favorite Indian lunch Buffet in Harleysville, Aman's, which I've reviewed and raved about. It was Saturday afternoon and Aman's was closed for some reason, with no sign or anything, is it closed for good? We were all looking forward to some good Indian Buffet, so I checked out my handy Yelp app on my phone, and saw that the Curry Leaf was about 2 miles down the road. So, we headed there. We got there at about 2pm. We were afraid that at that time the bars would be lacking (Aman's was sometimes)... well, they weren't. I have one thing to say about the Curry Leaf... WOW!!! The food was so good! It was all fresh and tasted great. They had a lot of different food items, and I tried a good number of them. They were all great. They brought 8 pieces of naan bread for the 4 of us. It was tender, yet crisp, and so good. I'm on a low carb diet and typically don't eat much bread, but I couldn't resist. I have to say, this is our new favorite Indian buffet in Harleysville!!! We'll be back!!!
