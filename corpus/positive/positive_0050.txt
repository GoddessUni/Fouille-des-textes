Nom nom, olive oil and balsamic vinegar...

First Starbucks helped move America from Maxwell House and Folger's to something resembling how coffee really should taste - bold and fresh - and then local roasters and boutiques took it up another big notch. Lucky for us, olive oil is skipping the high-end chain approach (so far) and we can go straight from Bertolli's and other supermarket stuff to REALLY GREAT OLIVE OIL - fresh, infused or fused if you like flavors, and far beyond the super shelf in terms of flavor. It's not cheap, but it's not really that much more than the stuff from the store, and would you rather wash your hair with Aveda or Pantene? You will pay for quality, my culinary friend.

Now let's cross to the other side of the gorgeous eggplant-and-green shop to taste the balsamic vinegars.

Ha, you thought the oil was good! I couldn't choose between the cinnamon pear, white apricot, white pear, or Tahitian vanilla (yes! nom nom), so i got a sampler with all four - plus a wild mushroom and sage olive oil and the Italian herb olive oil. I figured that if I didn't drink them in the car on the way home, I could try them and see what I used most, and then go get more of that. Actually, that wasn't my idea, but the suggestion of other Yelp elites - the wonderful owners were hosting us for an event, which gave me the excuse I needed to finally get myself into this fine shop. They let us sample everything, and you can too. They also have suggested oil/balsamic flavor parings that will knock your olfactory socks off. 

I haven't even mentioned the walnut oil. Um.
