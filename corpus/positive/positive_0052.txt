I've heard mixed reviews of this new place, but recently heard that they've ironed things out a bit. I went to try it with some friends and we really enjoyed our experience.

The three of us walked in at 12:30pm on a Friday, and there was a pretty hefty line waiting for us. The line goes relatively quickly considering how many pizzas they're making, but if you're in a rush, My Pie isn't a good choice. The line was almost non-existent at 1:15 though, so plan accordingly.

All together, we ordered one portion of garlic knots, two pies, and a chocolate chip cookie. This was a good amount for three people, and we ended up taking a half a pie to-go.

My friends ordered the Sneaky Salami, and they said it was fantastic; the Salami had a very good flavor to it, and the pizza was very well-made.

I created a custom vegetarian pizza, and it was very satisfying. I could tell how fresh the ingredients were. The flavors were really exceptional.

We shared a chocolate chip cookie, and it was PHENOMENAL. Sure, it's almost $3, but it's very large and can be shared easily between three people.

Now for the show stopper: THE GARLIC KNOTS. These things were to die for. The bread was so fresh; the outside crusts were perfectly toasted to golden-brown, and the insides were cloud-like pockets of piping hot goodness. One bite sent us all into a trance. The powerful burst of chopped garlic. The sharp tang of fresh Parmesan. The comforting smoothness of olive oil. All the ingredients were of the perfect proportions to make an unforgettable experience. 

There are many great things about My Pie, but I'll certainly be dreaming about those knots for while.
