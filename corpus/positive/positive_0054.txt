Eating at Kayne Prime was one the best dining experiences I've ever had. We ate here for my sister and her now fianc√©'s celebratory dinner right after getting engaged. The staff all came and congratulated my sister. The chef (who is phenomenal) kept sending "compliments of the chef" to us. Every single thing we eat was incredible. The popcorn lobster was surprisingly delicious! The steaks were all perfect. Their corn is the best side! Our server, Alex, could not have been informative about the menu. He was excellent. We had the best experience and the food was perfect. We will be back!
