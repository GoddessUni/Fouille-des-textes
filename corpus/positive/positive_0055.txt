My friend and I decided to try out Green Eggs Café as we were looking for a place to brunch and this place was conveniently located. We walked in and was greeted and were told there was a going to be a small wait. During this time, we looked over the menu and noticed many great options. Within five minutes we were seated to our table and realized that all the portions were very large. After looking through the menu and seeing the dishes, we were ready to order.

I ordered the chicken and waffles eggs Benedict. This is the best of both worlds with the chicken and waffles and the eggs Benedict all in one dish. This dish comes with a side where you can choose between fruit, grits, or potatoes sautéed and peppers and onions. My friend ordered the short rib with hash brown and the side of potatoes. 

The portions were huge just like we expected. The food was really good and just as I was anticipating. Having the sweetness of the waffles and the savory of the eggs benedict. Flavors were all there and very good. Be prepared to be stuffed! You'll definitely be rolling out of there!
