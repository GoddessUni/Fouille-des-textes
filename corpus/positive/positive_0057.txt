Yay - I'm a fan (....when I have a gift certificate or someone else is covering the tab....EEEEK).  I enjoy the fact that, although the Keg is famous for it's steak, there is a good selection of alternative options (chicken, seafood, etc).  The food has always been delicious and the service, pretty good.  

Maybe this only stands out to me but I have noticed that the servers here seem to be split evenly between male and female.  I don't know what it is but there is something off-putting to me about a restaurant who's front of house is staffed primarily with young women in teeny tiny outfits.  To me that screams "Our food isn't that great but we like tips so check out the view ;)."  Seems the Keg knows to let the food speak for itself - and it does!

Now on to price - it's expensive!  Usually a once a year type event, but it should be noted that when I do come here it is because I want to indulge - and indulge I do!
