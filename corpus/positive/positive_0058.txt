If the stockpile of Katie's cups I have in my cupboard aren't convincing enough of how much I love this place maybe this review will suffice. 

I have been here plenty of times and am never disappointed in the service or the food. All times I have visited there was a wait, even when we had a large party reservation, which may deter some but was a good sign to me. There's some cute street art & a mural outside that make for good photos while you wait. 

Food: Seafood Beignet was my first beignet when I moved to NOLA & it didn't disappoint. If you're not into the savory pastry movement this isn't for you but it's a really cool twist on a NOLA classic. I think it depends on season but mine was filled with crawfish. I've had the omelet here and a benedict both well prepared; but the benedict was on a special menu that day. 

Bottomless Mimosas: TBH this is why you come to Katie's & if not it's why you stay. Did I mention I've only visited during brunch? Anyways the plastic cups ( I favor over champagne flutes) are never empty & for $15 it's worth it.

Service: Go see Billy at the bar or is it William? It could be both take a chance & go see, they provided great service while we waited & even check on us after we were seated at a table. Gave us their card & when my friend returned 2 weeks later even remembered her name & the note we left them on the receipt. Some of the best service I've had in NOLA & I don't give that compliment to everyone (I was in the restaurant industry & can be picky)
