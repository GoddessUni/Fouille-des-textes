This is the holy grail of poke bowls but also acai bowls and lots of other things. 

Upon entry you'll notice plenty of outdoor seating, themed decor and menu screens for DAYS. Don't worry, the pleasant staff will walk you through all of it with a smile. 

We went for two poke bowls, big kahuna style for more protein, and proceeded to add the literal world to our bowls like mango, masago (fish eggs), crunchy garlic, you name it! 

It was a little tricky to eat the packed bowl given that it's served in a cone-shaped dish, so I'd recommend getting it in the flat-bottomed to-go box instead. 

I also tried the Hawaii Five-O boba tea, which was delicious but I felt a little small for the price when compared to other local boba tea joints. 

The menu is chock-full of desserts like dole whip and warm specials like curry. They really do have everything. We will absolutely be back again and again.
