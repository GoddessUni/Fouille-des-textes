Ghosts of the French Quarter:
This is an excellent tour. The tour guide, Ty, was waiting for the attendees and was easy to find.  The tour started promptly at the specified time and  we talked and walked for a full 2 hours in the French Quarter as advertised.  I can't compliment the guide enough. She set up safety protocols in advance of starting, spoke loud enough to be heard above the fluctuating volume of the area, was very knowledgeable on the subject matter, combined education with story telling in a very informative and engaging manner.  The group size is kept small which is a huge advantage to the enjoyment of the tour.  We passed many other groups that were so large they straggled down the block and couldn't have possible heard their tour guide.  I would not hesitate to recommend this company.
