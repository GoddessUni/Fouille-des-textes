Delicious!!! ALL the food that was brought out to our table all reminded me of my grandmother's cooking. The only thing that they could have used was an extra server. They had one server and one bus boy for the whole place and almost every table was packed. I think she would have been ok if one of her tables didn't yell out loud for her every 5 seconds. That table was rude and needy. They just kept yelling at her from across the room even when she was with another table. They kept snapping at her and waving their arms in the air and yelling in Korean. Even having to deal with rude customers that server stayed calm and very respectful. The restaurant was full and we still got our meal within 15 minutes. Service was pretty on point for only having one server, I just felt bad for her because she was running around like she was in boot camp. 

Besides all that... back to the food... the food was amazing. every single side dish was full of flavor and delicious and every dish we ordered came out perfectly cooked with great seasonings. Our group left very full and very happy.
