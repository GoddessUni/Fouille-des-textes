Not the first time we've been here, certainly not the last. Feel Parc has to be reviewed. This place is amazing! Location location location! What is better than sitting right at the edge of Rittenhouse Square, gazing out and enjoying a delicious brunch. 
My fiancee and I absolutely love the breakfast pastries and the coffee. It is worth it to come just for that, but everything above that is still awesome! 
She loves the mushroom tart and always gets it. Seems to be rather filling, as we always have extras for later. This time around I got the ricotta ravioli, which was delicious! The only issue is the small portion. You get about 5 raviolis and the sauce with the shaved parmesan cheese is a nice touch. 

All in all, Parc is definitely an experience and the service is not to be forgotten. Everyone is always nice and attentive. They do an awesome job and making sure your water or coffee are constantly filled! 

Going to Parc is a treat, if you don't make a reservation (especially weekend brunch) be prepared to have a nice wait. This place has become a staple amongst our brunch rotation and is always always a great and safe go-to!
