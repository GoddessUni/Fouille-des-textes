The Funk Zone is the place to be for many of the locals as well as out-of-towners. Its located two blocks from the beach and harbor. Located in a transforming industrial area and occupied by artists and surf shops, it is now home to many local winery tasting rooms and breweries.
At the apex of the Funk Zone is The Lark which brings California farm to table with local fresh fish and meat dishes. There are many other reviews of The Lark about the food, which is a real key part of going out for the evening but it is also having a  fabulous experience.    The service is attentive -the waiters taking the time to describe your food choices and the personable bartenders making great cocktails to be enjoyed at the bar, inside at a private table or a long communal table (a fun way to meet and chat with other people) or in outdoor area with fire pits.
Because of all the action in the Funk Zone, parking is tight but The Lark has top valet service -Lucas was excellent.This service is a must in not having to waste your valuable evening driving around the area looking for parking. 
You must experience The Lark; the food, the service, and....well just go there!
