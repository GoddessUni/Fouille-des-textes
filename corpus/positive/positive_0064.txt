Books and brews is an awesome concept, my hats off to whomever thought this up, and who knew they would expand like crazy with so many different locations? I live by the mothership in fishers.
But decided on Sunday to check out the south Indy location. It's right across from the university of Indianapolis in the old Shelby street bowling alley. They have worked wonders with the location! It's bright, spacious, with so many books, games and beers to choose from.
Books and brews also bought flat 12, so if you like flat 12 beers you can also get them as well now which just adds more variety. They have a good food menu as well, lots of appetizers, then sandwiches and pizzas. 
If you are a mug club member you get some nice perks, large pours of beer, 10 percent of merchandise and book exchanges. There are also mug club pint nights and the pours are 3.25. Great business and I'll be a repeat customer!
