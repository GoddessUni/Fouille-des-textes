In the mood for some spicy stews or soups to help us get over a winter bug, my SO and I wandered into Taco Riendo yesterday for lunch after a quick Yelp search for "Mexican." Parking was easy, the decor was cozy and comfortable, prices are extremely reasonable, and the menu's so comprehensive, you could come here for months and get something new every day. In fact, I probably will.

So, grab a menu from the basket next to the counter, make your order, pay, then sit down and wait for the deliciousness to arrive at your table. The girl working the counter was so friendly, and I was a bit amused by the Spanish soap operas playing on the TV in the corner.

The serving sizes were huge! You can grab a takeout box if need be. 
The three soups of the day and the specials sounded quite delicious, but we settled for the guisados - Mexican stews; the pork tips and chicken. The meat was tender and soft, easily chewed--perfect for a stew. They also give you potatoes soaked in the sauce. We both especially loved the tomato sauce with the chicken stew! My only criticism was that I wish they'd ladled more stew on the plate... but at that point, it might have overflowed. Let the stew get all over the beans and (delicious) Mexican rice, too. Yum. Flavor, flavor everywhere. You know that point when you're full, but you can't stop eating 'cause it's so damn good? Prime example, right here.

If you bring a bunch of friends, don't forget that it's BYOB!
