When you go here, ask for the traditional Chinese menu in addition to their Americanized version. The Americanized menu has some pictures to sorta guide you through the Chinese menu. I'm not a fan of Americanized Chinese food, so I don't have much the say about it that's positive (that's why I give this place 4 stars).  The traditional Chinese food is delicious. It's not as heavy or as salted as the Americanized food. 

Pro-tip: be sure to tell them any and all food allergies, sensitivities, or preferences. Their food descriptions aren't very good. For example, we asked for a tofu and vegetable dish. Luckily I mentioned vegetarian, because it had some pork in it. We would have missed it otherwise.
