Hubig's Pies are without exaggeration a New Orleans tradition. They are ubiquitous, appearing in pretty much every grocery, gas station, etc. You will find trays of those wax paper wrappers with Savory Simon (That's the guy's name, I promise) smiling up at you, offering you delicious sugary fillings. In fact, if you go to a new shop and they don't have them you're in the wrong spot. 

These little fried pies come in a variety of flavors:

Apple is your typical fried pie that you might find elsewhere.
Lemon and peach are fine if that's your type of flavor. They are bit sweet for me considering I like my lemon tart and my peach slightly more savory.
Pineapple kind of breaks my heart. I love fresh pineapple and the pineapple filling just doesn't live up to it.
Chocolate and coconut are the best of the pies but also hard to find since sell out quickly.
Lastly there is the holy grail of Hubig's pies, Sweet Potato. Long I've searched for one but never seem to find it, at least not on a day when I can work a pie into my diet. They have become so legendary I feel like I should battle wits with Indiana Jones before I can get one.

As tasty as they are they are completely bad for you. But what junk food isn't? So hide them if you must and eat them in secret. Use them sparingly to supplement a healthy diet and you won't suffer too much.

And save some for me!
