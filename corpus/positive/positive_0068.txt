After a long day skiing on 12/31/2021, my kids were tired of Casino's food and they wanted to try Taiwanese food while we're in Reno for skiing, they found this 101 Taiwanese restaurant a few blocks from Eldorado. It's quite a walk in the winter cold, but we got there and had a nice change of taste.
The restaurant doesn't have many parking spaces since it shares with a few restaurants, one way in/out.
The food was excellent and the prices were reasonable.
The kids liked the spicy dumplings (wontons?) although to me were over steamed (cooked), the sauce was excellent, they left the broken wraps for me to try.
I ordered the beef stewed noodles and it was good, although it didn't have much fatty brisket or tendon like other Taiwanese restaurants in CA, the soup and noodles were tasty.
My son and daughter liked the wonton and egg dropped noodles, they ate all with lots of chili oil. My son also liked the pork bun which looked quite delicious.
As any other kids, they must have boba milk tea of some kinds and they also liked them. They said they will prefer coming here again when we go skiing in march. For me, the price is right, the food is good and the service is very attentive, it's a thumb up.
