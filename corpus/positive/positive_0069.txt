Our waitress was awesome at the melting pot. We went for a date night so we were given a tiny little 'romantic' booth in the back of the restaurant. Would have been nice if it was a little bigger but at least it was private.
The dinner here was well timed with courses spread out by enough that there is no chance you will ever leave hungry.
We opted for the 'big night out'. This dinner option includes salad, cheese fondue, main course and desert for 2 people for around $100. The Caesar salad I got was weird, it was sweet instead of salty. After that everything was perfect. We opted for the oil fondue because it comes with a sesame and a tempura dip for all of the food. The dips did not really crisp up in the oil because I think they were too warm (the secret to real crispness is having hot oil and cold batter). It was still delicious.
For the desert we were brought 2 complimentary glasses of per secco and paired that with a milk chocolate caramel fondue, yummy.
You have to make reservations pretty far in advance to get in here, so if you've never been, plan ahead and make a night of it.
