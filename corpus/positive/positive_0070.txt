Best hoagies by far. I'd say we order from here almost weekly and have never had any problems at all. Have ordered online and by phone, order has always been exactly what we wanted. Everyone I've come in contact with who work here has always been very nice.  Everything is fresh and rolls are the best. Prices are just about the same as any other place we have been.  The turkey diablo & Nonnas veggies are my personal favorite.  Prices are just about the same as any other place we have tried and non compare to a Primo hoagie in my opinion.
