Really sweet couple that runs the place, and I must say the Fried Tomato Special (with turkey of course and some sharp provolone) is fantastic. My mouth waters just thinking about it.

Downside 1. its a small joint so they run out of bread (fresh from sarcones) at about 230-ish.  2. they get super busy and sometimes even if you place an order they don't get to you for a good 15 minutes or so. 

Regardless of the wait, I'd definitely go everyday if I could. Plus the side mozz balls in oil with basil and red pepper flakes. And now I'm drooling...
