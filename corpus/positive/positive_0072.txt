I was very hesitant to try this place.  A vegan brunch to nourish a hangover?  My immediate thought was a hard pass!
However, I don't get to pick every restaurant, and I was told under no uncertain terms that we were doing it.

Wowza, was I glad to be wrong!  Quaint atmosphere.  Friendly, attentive service.  Most importantly, delicious food.

A gluten-free, quinoa oat waffle.  Honestly, I make a pretty mean waffle myself, and this one was right up there.  Simply a delicious flavor.  I never would have pegged it for gluten-free.  Paired with a top-notch genuine maple syrup and an extraordinary fruit compote, I was simply stunned.
Shared a tofu scramble which was also quite good.  No, it didn't quite satisfy my craving for eggs, but as a vegan alternative, I was pretty impressed.  I felt they were a touch salty, but still tasty.

Took a piece of banana bread for the road.  As delicious a piece of banana bread as I've ever purchased.

I'd venture to say that I'll return here on my next trip to Philly.  Next time I'll be smart enough to make a reservation.  We were fortunate to get "bar seats" at the counter by the window.  The service was not at all lacking, and we got to check out all of the desserts behind the glass up front.
