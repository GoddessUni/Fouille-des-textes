We were in the area for Mardis Gras and on our bucket list was to have gumbo, jambalaya, red beans and rice, and a muffaletta. We had plans of places to go for these things, however our 11 month old daughter was not cooperating. We barely made it through the market before she bad a meltdown and we knew we had to stop and get food or we were done for the day. 
The Gazebo Cafe was right there and was not crowded. There was a band playing and the weather was great to sit outside so we picked a table and the waitress came over immediately. She was super helpful and friendly and helped us decide what all to get.
The food came out to us minutes after we ordered, which was awesome! And to top it off it was delicious! The Red Beans and Rice were sooooo good! The muffaletta was good, and the jambalaya was superb. 
I would highly recommend! Price wise, its exactly what you'd expect to pay in the middle of everything and the portions are very large.
