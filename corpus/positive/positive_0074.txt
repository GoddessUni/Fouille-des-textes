We went to Cafe Adelaide today for brunch with two other friends. Surprisingly, even with it being Jazz Fest, it was still as comfortable and bright as usual without the prices being altered. We chose to have mimosas and pointsettias before brunch at the table while we perused the menu. We have eaten here several times and have always loved it. The restaurant has a smaller, more intimate feel than some of the other Brennan's restaurants,and we find the service is consistent. No one ordered appetizers, but everyone ordered entrees. Two of us had the "Chegan Omlette"...very good, vegetable filled omlette. There was a nice salad on the side with a good drizzle (not pour or drenching) of dressing. We both enjoyed our meal. My husband had the Club Sandwich, with bacon, avocado, egg, turkey, etc. Very large and very fresh and delicious. He also had delicious hash browns (more like little cubes) on the side, and they were divine! I love hash browns, and these were not weighted down with onion and peppers...just nice potatoes with salt, pepper, a dash of parmesan cheese and maybe a hint of paprika. A purist's dream. Our other friend had bourbon soaked cabbage with pork. He enjoyed the dish initally, but said as it cooled off, it became too much of a one dish meal. But, he did say the flavor was wonderful and it was overall a good dish. Another great meal at Adelaide. What a great place. Everything was wonderful, from the reservationists to the servers, all. Prices commensurate with quality. Bon Apetit.
