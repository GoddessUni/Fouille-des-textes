A couple of friends and I went to Acropolis around 5pm on a Sunday evening. Although the parking lot is small and shared with other businesses, there was plenty of parking available. It seemed to be the perfect time to visit. 

Our waiter was fantastic! He was great at explaining the menu and giving suggestions. They had a 4 course special for $19.99 with several soup, salad and entree choices. I went with the 6 onion soup, Greek salad and an entree which name I cannot pronounce or remember. I'm not a soup person, so wasn't really feeling the soup. The salad was excellent! I will return for that alone. The entree was a flounder fish wrapped in pastry crust with a side of vegetables. The fish was big and thick. Personally, I prefer thinner pieces of fish. It had a good, distinct flavor in some portions and was lacking flavor in other portions. If the flavor would have carried all the way through, I would have loved it. I chose baklava for dessert and it was really good. I paid extra for a shot of Greek coffee (similar to espresso). It was different and strong, but I enjoyed it. I'd definitely be willing to return and try something different.
