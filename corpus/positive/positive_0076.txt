I'm really a Steven Starr fan, not a Garces fan because I generally feel like the food is really overpriced at the Garces places, but not with Amada! We went for restaurant week (another huge gamble, since I usually try not to try out new restaurants at Restaurant week since usually the service and food is not on par with how it usually is) for our anniversary and the food, prices, menu, and service were fantastic!

We each had a glass of red sangria, which was delicious - I think it had some cinnamon in in which really gave it a very well rounded taste. We had the white bean soup, which was just OK, but then we also had the cured meat platter (delicious and generous portions), garlic shrimp (very fresh shrimp which were perfectly done and not overcooked), the goat cheese (delicious and served with green apples which set off the taste perfectly),.

Second course was steak kabobs (the best I've ever had), grilled truffled mushrooms (also, the best I've ever had - we asked for extra bread to soak up the extra sauce), chicken with olive mashed potatoes (the chicken was very tender with a crispy, delicious crust) and a pan fried white fish that was the best fish I've ever had. We'll definitely be back to try out their happy hour 5-7 at the bar and more of their food!
