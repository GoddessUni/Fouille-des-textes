Been meaning to try this place for a while now. So glad I had the opportunity to check them out yesterday. I love the graffiti decorated building. It's a work of art. Was greeted by a very friendly guy. He informed me that he had just opened a bakery next door. Although I had stopped for a hot dog, I couldn't resist trying one of his home made pound cakes. I chose the peach cobbler. It was amazing. Saved half for my wife to try and she loves it too. Now, the hot dog. I am watching my carb intake so was so happy the bun wasn't huge. After all, a bun is a bun, it's the meat I wanted to taste. I chose a simple dog with shredded cheese. Ketchup and mustard. No lie; this was one of the best hot dogs I have tried here. The fries were lightly coated in a Cajun spice. Delicious. This will be our go to place for hot dogs now. Gourmet food at local prices.
