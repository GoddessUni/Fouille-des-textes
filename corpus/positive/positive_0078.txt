Who likes soul food? This guy. I grew up on it in Virginia and DC.

First of all, I went on a Saturday. They don't post hours and the hours on Yelp aren't correct. So I called ahead to confirm.

The food here was very good. I had the yams, collards and fried whiting dinner, with a side of white bread. The fish was very good (see pics), collards very good and yams pretty good (maybe a bit too goopy sweet for me) and mac and cheese was pretty good, not quite the way I like it (extra gooey) but certainly not bad.

I did have the problems where they didn't have everything on the menu I wanted (coleslaw and especially sadly the fried shrimp appetizer). Also, what soul food place doesn't make their own sweet ice tea?? Sacrilege. I guess I'm just too far North of the Mason Dixon line.

The service was nice and it was clean inside.
