Today was a holiday so I was scrolling though Yelp looking up lunch specials. I came across Ichiban and saw that they had half priced sushi on Mondays from5-7, so we decided to go. 
We ordered Hot and Sour Soup, California Rolls, and Unagi Rolls. The soup had tons of mushrooms and tofu and sprinkles of scallions. It was so flavorful and delicious. The sushi rolls were very good as well. We will definitely return to eat here.
The restaurant is located within a strip of stores on 31. It doesn't look much on the outside but it's very nicely decorated on the inside with dark wood and bamboo. The servers were very friendly and attentive. We look forward to coming here again.
