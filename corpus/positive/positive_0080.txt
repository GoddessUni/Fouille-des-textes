Anna's Sandwich Shop is a long established business in this area , having been established way back in 1935. While the building might be showing its age and the "FOR SALE" sign outside, this community has definitely embraced this business.

There is something to be said for a business to have lasted this long. Think about it, Anna's was already a well established business when the United States entered World War II. This business has seen its community change, as well as the world around it, yet it has been a constant in this neighborhood. 

They do give a lot of food for the money and the service is friendly and engaging. You could see that this friendly nature has helped this business last as the decades came and went.

I had a cheesesteak and while it was OK, it definitely was underseasoned. A bit of salt and pepper helped solve the issue, but I wish it had a bit more seasoning cooked into it.

Still, not a bad meal and the service will make you feel at home. I will give it four stars overall.
