This southern gal is determined to try all Indy southern "inspired " restaurants. I was excited to try with friends on a Sunday afternoon. We arrived around 12:30 pm and it was not packed yet. We were immediately seated by the staff. The restaurant only accepts cash! The food is family style. Our waitress was very friendly and informative. The food is served family style. You order an individual meat and group four sides. Also it includes a drink and your bread choice. 

Since the drink was free I ordered an "Uptown " (sweet tea/lemonade mix). The sweet tea was great! Also I ordered fried chicken others at the table had meatloaf and smothered chicken (gravy). For our table sides we ordered sweet potatoes (amazing!), collard greens (okay-made with beef stock), dressing (disappointing), and macaroni & cheese (only okay but the best I've had in Indy).

Overall the food and experience was great. You don't go here for the ambiance. You need to come here hungry because the portion size is huge and they have a policy about taking leftover food.
