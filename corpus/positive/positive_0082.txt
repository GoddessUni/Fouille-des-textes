Found this place in Yelp and the menu itself looked amazing so we decided to try it.  My daughter was going to get sushi and I was torn between ribs and the Island Pasta Dinner.  Well, she got a Krab sushi appetizer and the island pasta dinner and I ordered the ribs.  Unfortunately, they were out of ribs.  No worries since I had a backup ready and also ordered the island pasta.  We were NOT disappointed.  What a great meal.  Good flavor, a lot of shrimp and chicken mixed with the pasta.  We both took about half home (well, back to our hotel).  Our waitress was amazing.  I asked her if she had microwave safe to go containers since we were in a hotel.  They did and gave us those instead of Styrofoam.  She also gave us utensils to bring back with us so we're could finish out meals.  I wish I got her name to give her a mention here, but the receipt says Logan, so I'm not sure if that's correct.  Anyway, kudos to her for a great personality and fantastic customer service skills.  Yelp did not let me down this time.  Great food and people!
