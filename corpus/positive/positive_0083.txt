I came here for lunch on a weekday with 6 classmates and was pleasantly surprised that we only had to wait 10 minutes before being seated! I've been here for dinner once and we waited much longer back then because it was so crowded. If I come back, I'm definitely coming for lunch to avoid the long wait.

The fries are amazing here! They look and taste homemade and home-cut (if that is  a word) and so do the thick crispy chips that came with my club turkey sandwich, which was layered with gouda cheese and bacon--the gouda made everything melt perfectly in my mouth. The servings were big enough that I could split the sandwich with a friend. 

I tried my friend's fish and chips and the fish was tender and steaming when I pulled it apart to dip it in tartar sauce. I think I'll be ordering that next time I'm in the area to try paddleboating.

The only downside to the meal was the artichoke dip that my friend ordered. I kid you not, the dip came in a tiny 4-inch container.....it was one of the the smallest servings of dip I've ever seen, especially for $8. Though it was delicious and creamy, the appetizer portion didn't seem to be worth $8.
