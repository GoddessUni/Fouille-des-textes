This place was surprising good! I was sort of worried because franchise delis have let me down time and time again before. They had quality ingredients and the portions were pretty large. I like that you can select different artisan breads so the combinations are endless. We had the everything pretzel bread to go with our Reuben. I will say the only thing I disliked about the Reuben was that the kraut I was expecting to help cut the creamy rich Brie I added was actually more of a slaw mix. It was good but just would've preferred actual sauerkraut. We also ordered a giant cinnamon roll to go and it was soooo good. It was like the had wonderfully sticky cinnamon sugar honey concoction in between each layer I unraveled. I will definitely be coming back!
