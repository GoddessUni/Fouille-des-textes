I work very near the Corner Kitchen and since we discovered $5 Wednesdays we've become regulars.  Two of us are vegetarians and love the tomato and mozzarella wrap and the roasted veggie wrap.  I've also enjoyed the stuffed portobello dinner with amazing mashed potatoes.  We all love the kitchen fries and the string bean casserole.  The meat eaters love the burgers, meatloaf sandwich and salmon sandwich - and we're working our way through the rest of the menu.

What you really need to do is see if they have any baked goods - we love the blueberry tart, banana bread pudding with chocolate and all the "kitchen" cakes - so far we've tried the chocolate, carrot and banana.  I uploaded a picture of the banana.  I've told the baker that I think all the desserts are underpriced and if I were in a fancy white tablecloth restaurant I'd be happy to be offered her fabulous goodies!
