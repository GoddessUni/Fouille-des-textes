Extremely fresh, tasty and very reasonably priced Mexican food make this a must-try place to dine.

The interior is bright and basic but there is a good number of booths and tables that seemed adequate for the lunch crowd that kept coming on a recent weekday visit.

The menu is fairly extensive so be ready to spend some time reviewing the many options before ordering or do what I did and plan ahead. Check it out online and then step up to the counter to order without wasting time.

The food arrives quickly. is prepared expertly and will not disappoint. As tasty as everything was, including the chips and salsa ordered as a side, I could not resist adding some zest from the squeeze bottles of sauces provided on the tables.

Service is quick but take time to enjoy every bite. The salad that came with my meal was crunchy, colorful and provided a mouthful of flavor. The rice was moist and not over- or under-cooked. Had the blacked beans, flour tortillas and a chicken dish and loved it all!

Really enjoyed it, would recommend it and hope to enjoy a return visit soon!
