I love the Luke's on Alvernon, so I had high hopes for this new location on Speedway, and I was not dissappointed.  For lovers of Chicago style Italian Beef sanguiches, this is the real deal.
I'd give it five stars, except the place lacks some in ambiance.  Between the music playing in one corner, the sports coming from the television in the other corner, and the noise from the ice machine and kitchen, this place place was loud when I was the only customer in it.  A beef, fries, and large soda will run you into the double digits.  It's not cheap, but the portions are huge.
I'll let that all slide, however, because the food is so damn good and they have outdoor seating.
