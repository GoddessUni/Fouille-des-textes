What a pleasant  surprise to find  this delightful restaurant. The staff were super friendly, the atmosphere is cozy, the guitar player  was an unexpected bonus. The wine selection was better than most and offered in reasonable  price ranges. Now for the food: We started with the pan fried oysters...the freshest I've had in Boise ever! We opted for the prime rib...the wife had her medium rare, mine was medium, both cooked to perfection, very generous portions and the best I've had in the past 10 years...fork tender. The creamed spinach ...with their house ch√®vre was delicious. Unfortunately, by the time we finished our meal we were too full to order desert so I can only imagine how that would have tasted. We WILL be going back!!
