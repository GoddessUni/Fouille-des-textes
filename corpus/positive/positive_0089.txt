For the past few years visiting our son we have always stayed at this hotel. I just love the ambience, the location and the outdoor fire pits. Oh and the bar! Lol.  We drove up and there's a sign that Vogue named it #7 on its hot list of hotels to stay! How cool!! It use to be a motel and was renovated into a cute modern hotel. Lots of character and charm.  They even give you spuds when you check in. Lol.
I will admit I like staying in the handicap room. It's huge. Lol. This visit they put me in another room. Which is just as cute!  I love that they give you face wipes and well equipped with plugs! Drives me nuts when I got to a hotel and all the plugs are used!
My hubby loves the bed because they are super soft. No complaints I have to say!
