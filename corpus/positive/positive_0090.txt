#1 Indian Street food cafe in Tampa!  For anyone who knows Indian food, they know the street foods are among the best and most satisfying in the cuisine.

This is as authentic as it gets-- fresh dahi puri, pani puri, grilled sandwiches.  They offer a variety of street foods including chaats, sandwiches, smoothies, and even pav bhaji.  Not to forget, the have some specialty ice cream flavors that are very hard to finds, as well as some of the classics.

We ordered the dahi puri, papdi chaat and paneer panini-- totally satisfied!  One thing, if you don't like it too spicy definitely let them know as there is a standard amount of heat everything will come with but that can be easily modified for those who don't like too much.

Staff is very friendly and helpful.  The cafe is very clean and there is plenty of seating.

If you like Indian street foods, you'll love this place!
