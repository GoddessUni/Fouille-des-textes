Ok.  In order of significance.. Kaitlyn and Haley were marvelous hostesses.  Very friendly, food enthusiasts, not afraid to make recommendations which all exceeded our expectations. Food.  Delicious.  Red fish grill and the grilled tuna were superb. I have no idea what the sauce was for the tuna but unfortunately there was not enough sauce for two people.  Yes my wife was sneaking sauce from my plate.  But in fairness...I was sneaking on her plate.  DESSERT..OK I really wanted to rate this higher but don't want people to think I have no respect for the food pyramid.  Double chocolate bread pudding with ice cream.  OMG.     Atmosphere was energized and trendy ....probably because all the guests were quite happy.  Nice Job and thanks!!!
