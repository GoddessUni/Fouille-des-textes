I've given quite a few 5 star reviews, on Yelp and other sites, from taco trucks to pizza joints to trendy new restaurants -- but this is so much better than anything I've ever had.  I thought I'd had fine dining before, no, I have not.  Catbird is a cut above, truly a transcendent eating experience. All of the courses - I lost count - were special in their own unique ways.  Aside from the food, the drink pairings were spot-on and the decor was minimal yet perfect.  And the way the seats surround the kitchen, it's just so cool -- watching these chefs preform magic, and then give you your course and explain it to you.  I can't wait to go back...once my wallet recovers.
