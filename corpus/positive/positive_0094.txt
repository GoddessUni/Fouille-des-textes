Oh my goodness! I've finally be able to get in here to grab some dinner and seeing that I have two kiddos and zero adult time! I was NOT disappointed! I came in here with my two girlfriends for an early Sunday dinner and was blown away with the Montreal braised short rib!
I loved the modern vibe of this place- almost a cross btwn a upscale diner and urban gastropub? 
The dinner consisted of several small courses and the grand finale of the short ribs! I must admit that I wasn't hungry upon entering and was afraid the courses were going to be entirely too much but I was ablt to finish every course and have a nice helping of the entree!
The first course was a trio of amuse bouche bites-  I believe they was the chicken liver mousse, borscht tartare and potato latke- they were the perfect bite and so yummy, it definitely segway nicely to the courses to come. One of my favorite courses was the spicy friend chicken wings! They almost tasted like fried pork rinds! Oh so Good!
The roasted sweet potato was a nice sweet with a touch of heat, it was filling so I didn't load up on this, plus the hot peppers where a little too much for my sensitive palate.
The matzo ball soup was delicious! I could horde a gallon of that on a rainy day! 
The main course was everything I hoped it would be, presented with four types of mustard, a simple hearts of romaine lightly dressed with some oil and spices, a nice pickled cucumber, a shredded beet salad side and slices of rye bread to house the short rib.

The service was wonderful, the perfect mix of attentiveness and well timed courses- it really make our dinner an experience to remember! Abe Fisher is a great addition to Sansom Street's recent facelift!
