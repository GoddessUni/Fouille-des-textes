stopped in BurgerFi today for the first time and it was packed. i was anxious to compare it to five guys which ive always felt was way overrated. i made sure to check their menu offerings at home online before going just to speed up the ordering process when i arrived. they seem to have what most every burger joint has, a selection of customizable burgers, hot dogs, fries, etc. i went with four friends and because we had to hold our table, two of us stayed behind while the other three ordered. although we only ordered maybe five mins after the first three it seemed to take alot longer for our food to come. 

on to the food. the burgers were just okay. nothing spectacular. maybe just a little bit better than five guys (which isnt really hard to accomplish in my opinion). the fries were really good but not quite as good as five guys. the real standout at BurgerFi though would have to be their ginormous onion rings. these things are COLOSSAL. i will be gong back JUST for onion rings and fries. overall it wasnt a bad experience but i was expecting just a little bit more from the burgers. i would recommend hitting this place early to avoid crowds but that could very well be impossible due to its centralized location. 

and btw, the chairs in this place SUCK. they are extremely small and offer ZERO back support and are very difficult to even drape your coat/jacket over.
