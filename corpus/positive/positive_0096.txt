Bossanova serves quality food late, and has a wide variety of drinks to choose from. The bartenders are always friendly and the service is prompt. The tables are easy to adjust depending on the size of your party, and if you have a table of 8 or more, there are two tables in the back that are reserved for such parties. The martinis are the best in the area, and there are even bands that play there on occasion. 

The only negatives that I have are: 
1. reservations are not available ahead of time which is understandable due to limited space 
2. that the menu hasn't noticeably changed in the year that I have been a patron of this bar 

Favorite dishes: Beef Tepee, Coconut Shrimp, BST pizette. 

Favorite martinis: Dixie Normous and X-rated.
