This was trixy--so! If you don't like Kombucha, then take this review as a 3, lol. 

The sandwich was really good--a French Dip on Focaccia with some pepper jack. Great fluffy bread, dense and the au ju was really hot, but good. 

I also got a cup of chili ... which was so hot, I'm certain that within the tiny mouth of styrofoam was a gateway to the throne of Hades himself. I got maybe a bite or two until I couldn't feel my tongue and bailed on the prospects of meeting the Lord of Hell...

So, why did this jump back from a 3 to a 4?

3 words: Coconut Lime Kombucha. 

BOOYAH.
