Best pizza in all of Bucks County! Even better than the place that used to be in Trenton that is now in Yardley. Much, much better. So much better. The crust is delicious with nothing on it. They don't use the high-gluten flour that everyone else uses. It is much lighter. You don't feel like you ate lead after you finish. The sauce and cheese have so much flavor. Perfect amount of salt and spices. We had the Sicilian. The eggplant melts in your mouth. I was in Italy last month, and this is as good, if not better than anything I had there. Really authentic. Worth every penny. It is pricey compared to most pizza joints, but if you figure in the cost of a plane ticket to Italy to find pizza that comes close to how good this is, it's a bargain. If you like Domino's and Pizza Hut, this is not for you.
