Came here for happy hour and it was delicious. Everything was simple and fresh. Most authentic Japanese restaurant Iv been to in Indy. Tried the cream corn app and tempura squid, both great and came with sauce. Salmon nigiri was super fresh and at a great price. Happy hour (5p-7p)sushi menu is great and has a $5 special roll/ hand roll which is different daily. It was really busy and service was not that good. Dishes didn't get picked up nor did our drinks get refilled and my hand roll was not brought out. Def make a reservation if you plan on coming. Also they are NOT open on Mondays or Tuesdays.
