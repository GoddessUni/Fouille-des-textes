It is not often that I walk into an Indian restaurant and have a satisfying meal with prompt and courteous service to boot. Tamarind Restaurant on Fowler  Avenue in Tampa, has all the above going for them.
I first went there for their buffet and loved every dish! Their corn and spinach dish as well as the okra were delicious and the chicken with gravy was tender and not greasy. 
The next evening we were there for dinner and were charmed by the manager who spoke several languages and brought us  medium spicy " gobi manchurian "- an Indian- Chinese dish quite popular in India with cauliflower-as an appetizer. For the main course we ordered a grilled salmon dish for our guest who loved every piece. My husband and I had naan( popular Indian bread) and Kashmiri dum aloo ( potatoes in a creamy sauce ),a feast for the eyes and the palate. I could go on and on but let me end by saying that Tamarind is a great place for fabulous Indian food!
