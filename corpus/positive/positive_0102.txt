Best selection of wine and craft beers in south jersey/ Philadelphia, for an actually decent price!  You can "design your own 6 pack" of craft beers.  They have 4 rows full of craft beers by the bottle.  

You should get a frequent buyer rewards card, its free, and it entitles you to all the special prices. 
Also, you can buy a wine tasting card, good for life, go in and sample 5 wines each visit!  They also have cheese!!

Lastly, biggest selection of Jersey wines here, Valenzano, Amalthea, Tomasello, all the good ones :)

I live in Philly, and always stop at wine works to do my booze shopping every time im in Jersey.
