Sweet French ambiance! Made a reservation for two which seemed like a good idea because the restaurant was filled while we were there. We ordered the BBQ shrimp to share and they kindly split the portion between the two of us. The shrimp are giant and split it was about 4 pieces per person. It also comes with the heads and they were juicy!The give you bibs to wear too in case it gets messy but honestly I found it unnecessary. Prior we had fried oysters and the gumbo sampler to share. The oysters were really good, but I would have skipped the sampler. I was a bit disappointed with how small the portion was, so I'm curious how much a real gumbo portion is. Between the two gumbos, I preferred the seafood!
