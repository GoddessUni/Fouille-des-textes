We came here again on a Friday for lunch and the place was packed! We ordered a fiery chicken burger, baja fish tacos, and a nutella and banana milkshake. 

The fiery chicken burger, which came with mango salsa and wasabi sour cream, was a delight to eat. The two large pieces of fried chicken were doused with spicy-sweet salsa, and the wasabi provided a surprising kick. The mashed potatoes I got on the side tasted better than they looked. The coleslaw was dry and the only disappointing part of the dish. 

The baja fish tacos were okay, but kind of monotonous. I felt that they could have been more flavorful if there were a spice component. 

Though the milkshake was made with frozen bananas, the consistency was relatively smooth and there were no chunks of banana.

Our waitress was very nice and checked on us the perfect number of times (in my opinion, as a former diner waitress).

Overall, our experience this time was not as mind-blowing as our first time, but it was still a very solid meal.
