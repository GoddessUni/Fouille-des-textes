A must go!  Don't be fooled by the cheesy sign!  This place is right down the street from my apartment and I go as often as possible; not out of convenience but because it's truly that wonderful!
     The ambience is just right for beginning a night of fun in the quarter, a romantic dinner or a fine lunch. They have a wonderful wine list and one of the best filets I have ever had in the city. Honestly, I have tried almost everything on the menu and have enjoyed all of them immensely.  The wait staff is always perfect-kind, friendly and willing to accommodate any group. 
    They offer inside and outside dining which is particularly nice on a spring evening.  There isn't anything about this place That I don't like. Tried and true, a definite go to anytime!  I would recommend this place to anybody looking for a delicious Italian meal. You won't be disappointed.
