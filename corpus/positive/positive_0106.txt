My best dining experience in New Orleans overall, and that's saying quite a lot since I ate A LOT while there for 5 days. 

Our waiter, Travis, was very nice, polite, and more than willing to offer any advice as my mother and I struggled with making a decision from the lunch menu. My mother ordered the pork chop and I the pecan crusted puppy drum, which was to die for! I believe the pork chop came with red beans and rice, and as someone who eats a lot of beans (shout out to Latino households!) I can say that it was very, very good. 

My mother and I were to full to order dessert (much to our dismay), but Travis suggested the bread pudding regardless. Once lunch closes (2:30), you can come by and order from their smaller menu, dessert menu, and have some drinks in their faux-outdoors veranda area in the center of the location. My mother and I came back a couple days later just for dessert and drinks and the bread pudding is fantastic.

On the pricier side, but the ambiance and quality of the dishes lends to the higher prices. Furthermore, it is no more expensive than other locations in or around the Quarter, but you are receiving a better aesthetic, service, and food. 

tdlr; expensive, but worth it. Try the pork chop and puppy drums, and you can come back after lunch (closes at 2:30) on another day to get drinks and dessert. The bread pudding is to die for!
