We have been back to Prohibition several times now, and I finally pried my eyes away from the burger on the menu long enough to decide on trying something else.  I tried the Beer-brined Pork Loin sandwich with a serrano chili sauce and aged sharp cheddar.  OH MY WORD.  The bright and lively chilis woke up my taste buds and the pork loin with its au jus for dipping were just delightfully salty.  Incredible.  The flavors played so well with each other.  BF had some other pork special thingy that was a tad sweet but also flavorful.  I don't even remember because I was so in love with my dinner.  Great beers on draft as usual.  This place gets better and better.
