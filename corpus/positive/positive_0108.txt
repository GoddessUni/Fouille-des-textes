First things first - I live outside Philly. Despite growing up in New Jersey, I consider myself a Philadelphian from living there almost 30 years. 

I am here helping my sister who just had a kidney transplant. So the thought of finding a comparable cheese steak anywhere outside of the City Of Brotherly Love is usually a disaster. Philly Phlava is an exception to that rule. Is it on par with Steve's Price of Steaks or John's Roast Pork - my hometown favorites? No. But they make a formidable cheese steak. 

The key to any great cheese steak is the roll and this shop gets Amorosa rolls sent from up north. The meat was relatively lean and tasty (they could cut back on the salt - WAY too salty).The portion of meat was ok - not stuffed but not weak. I got a steak because that was what my sister wanted and I figured I would try it(she adds green peppers to hers - a major Philly no-no). I got mine the only way a true Philadelphian would - provolone cheese and fried onions. 

I liked the Philly sports apparel on the wall. Even some of the employees come from the area (like the excellent young lady working the counter who is from Maple Shade NJ - right over the bridge). I give it 3 stars when comparing it to cheese steaks in Philly. I give it  4 stars for cheese steaks in Tampa. The french fries were excellent (tried some my sister ordered).
