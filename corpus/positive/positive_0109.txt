My best friend relocated to St. Peter's a few years ago, and this was one of the first local restaurants that he wanted me to check out. I love the retro decor, and can only imagine what it must be like to be there after dark.

I had the patty melt and fries, which were both cooked well, and came to the table quickly. We were also offered to-go drinks, which I normally ask for, but didn't have to. We didn't spend any time playing the games, but were in and out quickly, and had a quality dining experience. Fun for the whole family, and a great way to show the kids some old school Americana.
