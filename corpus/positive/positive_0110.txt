Matt McGuire, the general manager and part owner, is the best restaurant manager in St. Louis which alone makes this place worth visiting.  He is extremely professional, watchful and solicitous.  

Food-wise, my wife and I tried the razor clams, gnocchi, salads and strip steak.  Razor clams were tres interesting, wriggling to and fro when we squirted lemon at them.  Gnocchi was the best we've had in St. Louis; the broth was simply outstanding with clams, bits of bacon and God knows what else.  The skirt steak, prepared with chimichurri, was mouth watering. Can't wait to go back to try the bone marrow and octopus. 

Central Table, in an instant, has become the best restaurant in the CWE, far surpassing Herbie's, Brasserie and 'Scape in the few days its been open.  Breezy decor ("high-end rustic", one could call it), countless food options, four independent kitchens hard at work, interesting seating choices from barstools to kitchen benches, nice selection of wines, extremely pleasant, professional and helpful service. 

Congratulations to everyone associated with it!  (Thank you Palm).

Finally, a great place to go in St. Louis in addition to "Niche".  And thank God they don't have a TV(s) on constantly - everywhere-  flickering sporting events no one wants to see.
