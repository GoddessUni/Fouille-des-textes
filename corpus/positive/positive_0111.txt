Background - I want some Mexican food for lunch and we were at Meadowood Mall.  The Yelp app told me to come here.
 
Atmosphere - I remember coming here when it was Murrieta's, yeah years ago.  Now can you say orange?  I know it is pumpkin season but this is crazy.  They have Mayan themed art all around the place reminding me of Yucatan.  When we walked in there was only one person in the place sitting at the bar watching college football.  By the time we left there were two other couples.  So strange for lunch hour.

Food
  Drink - Just water, maybe should have had a Corona.  Lots of limes needed for my taste.

  Meal - This is not the standard free chips and salsa.  Light thin chips with not one but three choices for dipping.  A classic salsa which also came with a bean dip, but the winner for me and almost finished it off by myself was this warm salsa.  Sorry I did not get a name of it.  Warm, as in the temperature and heat level which surprised me that I would like a warm salsa.  I ordered the California burrito with Asanda.  Meat was great, size of pea gravel, stuffed along with cheese and rice.  I could not finish the burrito.  Clearly I ate too much salsa.  

Service - I do not know where to put this but here is a good spot.  The menu did not flow from one item to the next or even section.  Then they were not very consistent with language.  Some items were in Spanish or English and then majority with both.  The staff was great.

Future - If in the area again and wanting Mexican.
