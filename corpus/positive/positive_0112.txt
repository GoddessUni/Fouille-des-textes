Baja Cafe does not disappoint. The Ina location is small, but it has a nice little patio. There is a great set up for kids which is definitely appreciated! 

The food and drinks are awesome. I've had a few different things but the waffles and the Haystack really stand out. The portions are HUGE and everything was hot and delicious. I had a prickly pear mimosa that was fantastic along with a great coffee. 

The service is always solid and that is with a busy restaurant on a weekend. I served for a long time and I appreciate a solid server! Baja is my top brunch spot on the NW side.
