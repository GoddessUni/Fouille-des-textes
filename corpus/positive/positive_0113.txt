I'm new to the area and wanted some mexican food. Came here last night to try it out! The parking is pretty limited for this restaurant but I was able to find a quick spot in the back. The restaurant itself is really cute and the menu had a lot of options. I ordered the soft tacos with steak. The steak was really well seasoned and the salsas were good. The chips were not that special so I didn't enjoy them as much. I ordered black beans but got pinto which were okay. The beans were presented nicely. I wish I had asked for flour tortilla instead of corn for my tacos. The rice was good. Overall this place is good. 13$ for two soft tacos, rice, and beans. Salsas are unlimited refill!
