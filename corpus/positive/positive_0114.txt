My wife and I took our first trip together down to DC back in March of '14, and we ended up having a great time at a CG down there. Then on another trip to Philly, we stumbled upon one and figured why not - another great time. So another visit to the one in Baltimore, and it became a thing. If we're somewhere for a few days, we seek out a Capital Grille. Oddly enough our company owns a building where the one in NY is, and we haven't been there.

Love the wine list, it's like being a kid in a candy store. And they are more than happy to recommend.

I've never actually had the steak here. It's tough because we've only been here while on vacation somewhere and they don't have lunch hours at the ones we've been to. Or we are there on a day they open later. And while on vacation the wine usually starts flowing pretty early, by the time 5:00 rolls around, I'm feeling something lighter. But my wife has almost exclusively had the steak, and it's always been cooked to perfection and a solid cut. I generally end up with a crab cake or something along those lines. We've also had the seafood tower, always a great choice.

By far, our favorite chain steakhouse.
