Let me start off with this disclaimer. If you hate metal music, I wouldn't come here. If you can tolerate it COME HERE! I can't speak for the burgers myself, my boyfriend really loved his though, because I am a vegetarian. That being said, the veggie burger was really good! Great that they have a veggie option for being a place so focused on meat. It's also nice as a vegetarian that I can pick any of the burgers on the menu so each time I go, I can have something different and not have to get the same, only thing on the menu that is vegetarian, option that most meat focused places have. 

They had one of the best IPAs I've ever had from Founders. So good! Bartender was great, friendly and great service. 

When I was there, I saw the Mac and Cheese and will definitely be back to try what looked like pure, cheesy heaven, minus the bacon. 

A great vibe to the restaurant. The music is loud, it's supposed to be loud so don't come here expecting to have a romantic date night. It did take a bit to get the burgers but at a place that has such a good beer selection, who cares. 

Also, they played Sharknado on the TV bar. That just says it all about how great this restaurant is.
