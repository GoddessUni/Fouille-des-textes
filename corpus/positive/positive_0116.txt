Corona Village is marked in my books as the place to get the best cheese dip aka queso I've ever had. Oh my gosh. It's thick, it's heavenly, and it's actually made from real, melted, bonafide cheese. Like, don't get it if you don't want to be addicted. In addition to the queso extraordinaire, Corona Village is a great place to get some yummy Mexican food for a reasonable price. We are fans! 

Food: OH MY GOSH THE CHEESE DIP. In fact, your receipt will probably say "cheese deep," which really made me laugh the first time I saw it. "I'll take the Cheeese deeeeeep pleeease!" Anyway, their fajitas are also BOMB, and the sample fajita platter (for one) is not only HUGE. but the taste is also superb. Ours is always cooked to perfection and comes with a ton of extra tortillas. The burritos, quesadilla, chips, salsa and bean dip are also good. I'm definitely a fan of their fried ice cream as well! 

Drinks: Heavenly blended margaritas. The grande's are so good! Yum! 

Atmosphere: It's a tiny joint, so there may be a wait if you go at a busy time. The ONLY THING I don't love about Corona Village (similar to other Mexican spots), is that I leave and have to throw my clothes immediately in the wash or they smell like the kitchen until they're clean again. Does anyone else have this issue? 

Service: They sometimes seem rushed, but our service has never been compromised. They're always nice and always checking in on us. 

Happy Hour Offerings: n/a

Healthy Hack: Chicken tortilla soup without cheese! It has tons of grilled chicken and is really light. The cup is plenty.

Tips: Try the fajita sample platter. It's so good!
