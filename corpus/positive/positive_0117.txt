First timer!  I wanted to get some quick meals for lunch this week because I had plans on Sunday and wasn't going to be able to spend a lot of time prepping food. I took a shot. So far I'm happy with the food I got but I have to say the prices are astronomical. I like that it's fresh, not frozen so there's no added junk that you don't want to consume. However, 4 lunches cost me $42!  Is that the same amount if I ate out for lunch every day, sure. But I don't!  The worker behind the counter also wasn't very helpful. I felt sort of lost and was struggling to find what I was looking for. I'd probably return but only in a pinch!  The main deterrent for my return is the cost.
