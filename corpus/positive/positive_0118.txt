I'm literally eating my to-go order and writing this review. I live downtown and Sen Thai has been one of my go to spots. I never thought of it as really good but it's good and in a great location. Today, I ordered the salmon teriyaki meal to-go and brought it home. First, I like how they placed the salmon in the to-go container with the skin side up and the flesh of the salmon in the teriyaki sauce leaving the skin crispy. Secondly, after plating it (picture attached, took the carrots out) and seeing how well the salmon looked, I was excited! Lastly, the flavor and crispness of the salmon and teriyaki sauce was DELICIOUS!!! This will be my go to meal, next time I will eat it at the restaurant to see if I have an even greater experience!!
