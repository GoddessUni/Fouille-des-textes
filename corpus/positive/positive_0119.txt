These people are not messing around - when they say fresh, they mean fresh! Every single ingredient was full of flavor and had an incredible texture. The croutons in the caesar salad honestly blew me away (croutons?! I know!). All the cheese they used would put you in cheese euphoria. 

My husband ordered the meatball pizza which made us want to come back just for the meatballs alone! I ordered the Covaccino pizza which felt a bit like charcuterie on a pizza lol (and I'm not complaining about that).  It could have used a heavy swig of balsamic reduction or something to cut through the richness, but it was a real treat. 

We could have probably split one pizza and added some apps but it was fun having leftovers (and they tasted just as good for lunch the next day!)

Highly recommend bringing a bottle of wine with you since it's a BYO!
