It's one of the nice Thai restaurant in town. This is my second visit here. I am quite please with their dishes on both visits. I had the Basil fried rice, Pad Thai, Chicken Satay and Soft shell crabs with basil sauce.  The soft shell crab with basil sauce is highly recommended. I love the full fragrant of basil, slightly spicy, sauce with sliced shiitake mushrooms on perfectly deep fried soft shell crabs. It came with a bowl of delicious curry rice. 

I'm pleased with the friendly service and a clean and nice atmosphere of this restaurant as well. I will definitely come here again on my next visit to Philadelphia.
