I have the enemy sandwich which was on point, one of the best I've had in my life. It came out superquick. I would certainly come here again. Wish I lived close to this restaurant. I also had the three color dessert which was excellent. The staff was also nice enough to put in Ice for me and to prepare well. Frequented by locals,  Mostly Vietnamese clientele.

Next time I will try the other dishes. Kind a wish I bought more than just two sandwiches. The prices is also not expensive at all. About three dollars for sandwich.

The bread is also crucial to Academy sandwich and it was just right, crunchy on the outside and very soft on the inside
