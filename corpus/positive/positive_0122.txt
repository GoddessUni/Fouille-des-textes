Oh my god where has this place been all my life?!?

There isn't much to say.  If you love pretzels, go here now for the best pretzels in the city.  If you don't, go here now and I'm guessing you will by the end of it.  

The price is right at about $2.00 - $2.50 a pretzel (cheaper if you buy a dozen).  Grab a couple and try a variety with a friend.  My favourite is the garlic butter.   

Service is friendly.  There is often a line and a bit of a wait (especially on weekends), but I have never had to wait more than 5-10 minutes. 

A can't miss in the city!
