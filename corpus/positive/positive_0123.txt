The rib sandwich is one of the best around. I usually go once a week, except during Flower Show week where its best to avoid the market because it gets to crowded.  The sandwich combo comes with 2 sides.  I usually get mac and cheese and potato wedges or just go with the double mac.  The potatos are good, the mac and cheese, while not spectacular, is pretty darn good. One reviewer compared it to the blue box stuff, thats just ridiculous, not a chance.  The beans however are from a can, so unless you like the taste of canned beans, I would go with the 2 starches. Try pouring some of their hot sauce( which is more tangy then hot) on the potatos and mac and cheese, that really makes them good.  Are these the best ribs on the planet, no, is this place an insult to all amish, not even in the slightest, eric s should have his head examined.
