First off, you have to know that this place is 100X more than just chili.  Not really sure about the name choice, but there are selections a-plenty.  I'm impressed by the HUGE menu.  I haven't had a chance to sample very much of it, but so far it's been really good.  Service is good, staffing is friendly, and it's really nice to be able to sit outside at Citygarden and have a nice meal...can't beat the view.  Also, apparently you can get anything/everything on the menu to go.  So, order up, and take it for a short walk and sit anywhere you like.  I think this place has potential...better than the last place, that's for sure.  Did I mention that they have a HUGE menu?  Dear God....oh, and if you have room, you have to try the cheesecake or the cookies for dessert.
