This will be my go to spot for fast, fresh and healthy seafood. The employees here are very friendly and helpful. My first time here the young man explained the different dishes. He let me know what most first time customers ordered and offered some recommendations. I ordered the Monster burrito. It has shrimp, tuna, imitation crab and rice. Let me tell you this was yummy. I could taste the freshness. (Writing this review is making want it again). I'm not sure what the wrap was made of. You definitely need to try this with the ginger. All I can say is OMG. This was definitely worth every penny.
