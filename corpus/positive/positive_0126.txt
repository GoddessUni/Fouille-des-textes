We just moved here from California and I was looking for a good place that served breakfast all day. Los Altos was near my house I tried it and now I'm so happy I did. This is my new favorite place. I checked it out first and they assured me they would make whatever I wanted with my special diet as long as they had the ingredients. They made for me the perfect omelette exactly the way I wanted it to be with egg whites and mushrooms one of the best I've ever had. I got sauteed vegetables on the side and they were wonderful. Then my family has tried just about every dish on the menu and have not been disappointed in one. Their steak is outstanding you can tell they use great quality meat. My husband has tried the fish and chips and salmon both had excellent portions and you could tell they used only fresh quality ingredients. We are used to paying a lot more for a lot less in California so we are so excited about this place. My only criticism is that they close Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday nights or we would be here every night. I should also mention that the owners and the food servers are all so very nice.They make you feel like you are part of the family.
