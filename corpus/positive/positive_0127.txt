Awesome Asian grocer (they carry some hispanic foods, as well).  If your nose can handle the smell of fish and strong, fragrant, dehydrated packaged goods, Seafood City is worth a visit. 

It's a tad disheveled, but larger and wider than most of the Asian grocers in town.  They have aisles and aisles of asian grocery goods, a fresh produce section, a small bakery area, and HUGE seafood area with critters that are still crawling.  You better know how to scale and fillet yourself, because the fish come from sea to store and don't pass through the butcher on the way.

You will find ample supplies of anything you might need for Asian cooking.
