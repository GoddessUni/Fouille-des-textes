I've only tried Hearthside twice, once last year and once recently but would review both visits the same.  The ambiance and service are top notch.  It's a gorgeous little space and I love watching what's happening in the open kitchen.  The octopus dish was outstanding, as was the sea bass.  But the pastas are absurdly salty and I'm not someone who is afraid of flavor!  Generally I'd like to see them back off of the butter just a little in most of their dishes.  Also, as others have noted, it's really off-putting to sit down to a pricey meal and have to pay an additional $5 for bread.
