I was impressed by the food, service, and ambiance of this place. I was visiting Philadephia for the New Year, and the first encounter that I had with food in Philly was the Dan Dan noodles at this place. I am someone that can't eat spicy food. Nevertheless, I relished it beyond words. Then, we asked the staff to lower the spice level a bit (because of me), and we were served more awesome food with the right spice level for my taste. The fish (I can't reckon the exact item in the menu, but it was fish in a fish-chilli oil sort of gravy) was succulent beyond words! 

If you are a hot-and-spicy food lover, please land here!
If you aren't, then also land here. They will accomodate you and you will not be sorry.
