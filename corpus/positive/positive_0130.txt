Okay, so my daughter was turning 1 and I just knew I'd be able to find a cute little cake with no nuts or anything (not sure what allergies she has yet), WRONG! So it's the day before her birthday and me being hot mess mom overestimated my time thinking I would have time to bake a cake WRONG AGAIN! So I consult the googleverse and cross check the yelpland and HERE WE ARE! This is the most adorable Bakery! There are so many options! I literally walked in shortly after they opened and asked for a plain butter cake, they didn't have any made because its not a common seller (understandable). I put in my order and she said it would be ready in an hour YEEESSSS AMAZING! I got the drizzle icing option. This place is a delicious lifesaver. I've already recommended all of my friends here. I love this place. They also have candles and I got a CUTE glitter candle, not to mention they can do really cute decor! Just check out their website and order! You won't regret it!
