My FIRST EVER amuse-bouche. YAY! 

If I had one wish, it's that someone had told me that the restaurant is INSIDE the hotel at 210. You have to go back into the depths of the building and up a floor, too. It isn't very well signed, either. I felt like I was breaking and entering into the hotel, sneaking around,  but that's likely because of my colorful past. 

The sweetbread appetizer easily won the first course, over the lobster chowder (bland, but with a nice avocado accent), and a solid , if average, salad.  

I can't say enough about the duck entree. The duck was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. the sauce was plate-licking good. The best component was the cabbage egg roll, which was generously portioned and would have been satisfying on its own.  The cod entree was like butter in your mouth, served over finely seasoned Israeli Couscous. If I went back, I would order both. at the same time.  

Desserts were both odd. Smoked mouse/passion fruit option was muddled, with too many components and little satisfaction. The apple dessert was strange, bland, and forgettable. Except the paper-thin apple chips. yumm. I wanted to ask for a duffelbag of those babies to go!

For restaurant week, I spend $35 on dinner and then $25 drinks (one cocktail and a quarter of a bottle of wine). 

Don't forget cash to tip the coat guy! Service was outstanding. The waiter knew we were cheap RW kids and made us feel comfortable and welcome anyways. Truly classy. 

Plus, the decor and view are just spectacular.
