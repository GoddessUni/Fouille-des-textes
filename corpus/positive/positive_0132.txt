Dinner last night was absolutely amazing! We wanted to try out Bacio Kitchen, my sister spoke so highly of them and hired them to cater her wedding this July. We had a friendly and inviting welcoming and started our meal with some amazing appetizers.  The fried olives were absolutely amazing as was the flatbread du jour which had the most delicious red pepper sauce drizzle.  Followed by a delicious Caesar salad. For our meals my mother ordered the special, short rib ragu, my sister the short rib entree and I ordered the Salmon entree.  Everything was absolutely amazing  we enjoyed every minute of our time there.  Our server Brandon was AMAZING! Even remembering my sister and her fianc√©e from their previous visit.  Chef Robert came to our table to see how we were enjoying his amazing food. From start to finish it was an amazing experience and I can't wait to go back!
