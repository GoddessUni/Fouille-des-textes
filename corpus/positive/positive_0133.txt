This place is a favorite of mine. They have never disappointed - both their food and their service continue to exceed my expectations. From the outside, it seems like just another South Philly dive bar, and in a lot of ways, it is. But come inside, and, after your eyes adjust, you get a glimpse of the decadent burger and pile of fries (or tots!)  being brought to a woman at the bar, and a whiff of the seitan wings and mountain of nachos being enjoyed by the group in the back and you start to get what makes this place special. I have brought several carnivorous and vegan friends here, and everyone has been able to find something that they love; what's not to love about elevated, expertly prepares bar food? Whether you're looking to have a boozy brunch or a casual lunch or dinner, I cannot recommend Royal Tavern enough!
