Village Turkey: had crispy bits of skin clinging to them. The turkey flavor was brightened by the smokiness and fat from the bacon. I loved the added twist of the cherry spread; it established the savory, salty, sweet trifecta. The arugula provides the bitter element if you like that sort of thing, or you could sub in spinach.

 Philly Wasabi:  I absolutely love wasabi and how it adds not only spice but flavor; the nose tingling, allergy clearing creamy wasabi spread was amazing over the steak. The American cheese blended in completely and added to the creamy, salty bliss. And those crisped fried onions on top are just an added present.

Now on Mondays, you can get one of Jake's Whole Roasted Pork Sandwiches for $5 dollars. I don't even have to tell you that this is the same price as a sandwich from Subway. While the meat wasn't the thick, hand carved slices of pork that I expected, the chunks of pulled pork mixed with the crisp skin cracklings and spicy chili relish served me well. They pack a ton of juicy meat into that sandwich.
