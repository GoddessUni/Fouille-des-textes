Walking through downtown Phila with my vegan and veggie daughter, we decided to stop by Bar Bombon for a vegan meal. Omg, the most amazing vegan I have ever had! 
Items ordered; "chicken" empanadas, "chicken" enchiladas, salad with a tasty herb vinaigrette, chunky, spicy guacamole and chips, and the kids got a side French fries with saffron Parmesan "cheese." Everything was marvelous! 
Service, our waitress was friendly, informative and attentive. 
Decor; a South Beach Miami vibe, Latin music and palm trees wallpaper and birds of paradise flowers. Large windows open up with brightly colored plantation shutters, open air to the hustling-bustling streets. Inside is small, only a handful of tables, full bar with about 15 stools, and a couple outside tables, so plan head and possibly make a reservation if it's a busy time of day. 
Will definitely return next time I am back in Phila.
