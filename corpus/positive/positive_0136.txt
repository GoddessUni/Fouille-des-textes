This place is awesome. They have an assortment of unique pizzas that are so good. The same guy always tend bar and runs the register and he is great. He also makes fantastic drinks. The pizza is good, I do not agree with any reviews about a decrease in quality. I have been here three times in the month I have lived in reno and it seems to have gotten better every time. Even on friday and saturday night when it is busy and there is a line, the wait is never that long because of the speedy service. There isnt a ton of seating in the place, but I think that adds to the atmosphere. It was a great place to hang out. Oh, and they play cartoons on the weekends which is pretty awesome too. Go check this place out if you are visiting reno or havent been and live here. It kind of embodies what reno is all about. They also have bottomless mimosas on sundays!
