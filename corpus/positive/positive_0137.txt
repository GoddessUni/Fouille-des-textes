A very interesting twist in tacos. I highly suggest this place if you're looking for some fusion food. I had all of the tacos in the $3.50 section. The pork belly and duck was my favourite. Although, I have heard complaints from friends that their duck is often dry. For dessert, I had the churros. It was crispy on the outside and softly textured on the inside, the chocolate on the side was a real plus too. The ambience outside is lovely, great for dates especially. Overall, a nice place with a good twist on the your palette but a little overpriced.
