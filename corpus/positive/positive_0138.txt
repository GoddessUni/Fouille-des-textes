We visited Charro Steak during a visit to the area. We were a party of four (including two elementary aged children, one who is a HUGE carnivore). The steaks were absolutely fantastic! The filet was flavorful and like butter!!! The brussel sprouts were phenomenal! Our carnivorous son devoured his steak and shared some of both mine and my husband's. Our server (and I will modify this review with her name once I locate our receipt) was delightful. The manager checked in with us during our visit which is a practice I love to see some still do. Next visit, we'll be back!
