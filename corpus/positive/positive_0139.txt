The first time we drove by, we missed the place because, honestly, the sign looks more like a demolished sign pole with graffiti.  Thankfully the inside doesn't look run down at all.  In fact, the place looks hip, with two big center tables that look like they are crafted from a giant piece of driftwood. 

As we sat down i noticed the authentic, Japanese, bamboo ramen soup spoon. That's a good sign.

Their lunch menu is very limited, and we were disappointed that many of the ramen, which pictures I saw on Yelp, are not available.  There were shoyu ramen, veggie ramen, ramen salad, and three rice bowls.  

The bowls arrived, and one look at the eggs, and I can say this place is legit! The ajitama (marinated egg) has the most gorgeous yolk, lovely like a setting sun and teetering between runny and firm.  The ontama (hot spring egg) is done right - so many places serve soft boiled eggs as ontama - with tender runny white.  

Both the shoyu ramen and veggie ramen are great, though the miso/tomato broth of the veggie ramen has a more complex, and interesting flavor.   

I asked the waitress for some shichimi togarashi (seven-spiced Japanese chili pepper powder) and was impressed when she replied that she has both ichimi and shichimi, and proceeded to bring me a generous amount, not in a bottle, but in a little dipping dish.  Now, I've been to a Japanese restaurant where they brought a bottle of Badia black pepper.  This along, proves that Ichicoro is the real deal!
