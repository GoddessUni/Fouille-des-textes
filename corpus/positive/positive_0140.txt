Wow is all I can stay! I am still in awe from the amazing dinner and service we received during our visit. It was a little tricky getting to the floor since the elevator was broken, but when we finally got there we saw a beautiful sunset while enjoying a drink. 

All tables are seat yourself. We were able to grab one overlooking the ocean which was awesome! My husband and I shared the crab stuffed shrimp, scallops, and Ahi Tuna. All were absolutely delicious, but the Tuna was our favorite! Our waiter, Mustapha, was terrific! He timed our orders out perfectly and was attentive to everything we asked for. This is a MUST visit! We will definitely be back!
