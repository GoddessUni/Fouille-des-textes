The wings are what's up at this place!

I have to say the wings are quite good, as was the beer and the other goodies we had.   I would highly recommend this place to whomever is looking for a good chill time at a nice bar out.

The one thing I would like to say is the Chipotle Lime wings were awful, please be sure to order at your own risk.   I tried them out at the advice of the other yelpers and was highly disappointed.   The regular hot wings were excellent as were the honey BBQ.

Stick to the basics and enjoy!
