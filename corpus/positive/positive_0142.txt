We flew into Philly late Tuesday and after we checked in we were looking for a place to eat as most places had closed their kitchens. We got there around 11-1130 and the server was with us within a few minutes with some beer suggestions. After a few minutes of analyzing the menu, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. This place looks as "divey" and "underground" as possible but they had things like Duck Pot Pie and Brisket Grilled Cheese. Gourmet food was a shocker. I ended up ordering the baked Mac N Cheese with Blueberry Cornbread. At 11:30 at night I had low expectations but it was DELICIOUS! The Mac N Cheese was bubbling when it came out and covered in crunchy corn flakes to give that fantastic contrast in texture. The Blueberry cornbread was the perfect moist interior to crisp exterior ratio. And the blueberry wasn't too overpowering. This would definitely be a spot I would visit again if I was ever back in Philly. Cheers!
