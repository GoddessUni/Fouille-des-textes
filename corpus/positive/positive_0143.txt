Thanks to my co-workers I love coming to Frankie's. They have a convenient online ordering feature that allows fast ordering. If you are military, it is best to call your order in because, they do offer a discount. Unfortunately, this discount is not featured on their online ordering. My favorite sub here is the Cheesesteak with Cheese Wiz! This is by far one of the best sub places around with a taste of Philly! The parking lot can be a little crazy but, I have seen worse. If you have not eaten here before, I highly encourage you to do so.
