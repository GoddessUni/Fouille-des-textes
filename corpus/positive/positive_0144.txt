This has been one of my favorite finds in the Garage Food Hall since dining here a few times. 

You might recognize the owner - he also owns neighboring Festiva up on 16th Street. 

I ended up ordering the crispy Japanese eggplant and the tofu jorim tacos. Both were....stunningly delicious. I have told so many people to visit the Garage, if it's only to try these tacos. I was very happy.

One thing that could use some major love/improvement was the service. In many ways, service is just as, if not more than, important as the services/products you purchase. I came back for some napkins as they didn't get handed out when I picked up my food. A rude "Well, did you even order from us?" comment was made before reluctantly giving me a mere two napkins. I get it, resources are tight, but c'mon. It's a napkin for a fairly messy taco. 

Regardless, I'm sure it was just an off day, and I can't wait to come back and get these tacos again!
