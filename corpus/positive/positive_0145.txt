I have been coming here for 20 years through 3 various owners.  The current setup is awesome.  They classed up the bar but did not destroy the history.  The food is so good I don't have the words to describe it.  The best part is the staff.  The current owners have found people that enjoy their jobs and interacting with you.  I walked it to a packed house and with in 30 seconds I had a menu in front of me.  One min later the other bar tender greeted me with a huge smile and took my order.  When it slowed down he chatted with me and offered drink suggestions.  As far as what you want in a bar/resturant experience, you could not ask for a better experience.  Well done all around.
Happy local guy.
