Upon first glance Café Lift is one of those place that makes you cringe and groan: ugh do I really have to go to Spring Garden and 13th to risk getting potentially mugged for Sunday brunch? Really? Why is there an over hour wait during peak times and there is literally no where to explore in the neighborhood? I'm guessing this place is going to be sooooo pretentious with it's hipster faux industrial interior décor and definitely young hipster clientele. 

At least that is what I thought the first time I went and yet it is one (out of 2) of my favorite brunch places in Philadelphia because they deliver one of the most delicious brunches in a budget friendly and non-pretentious way! 

The star is definitely the cannoli French toast: a delicious concoction with Challah bread, mascarpone cheese, banana, and chocolate chip! What a genius combination that doesn't need any maple syrup! I am so torn every single time I go because I really want to eat that particular French toast but then I also want to eat other things. So I always wrangle my brunch mates to do 50:50 with me on a savory plate too. The savory plates are delicious too: from huevos rancheros to the fritattas and breakfast sandwiches. The 50:50 solution makes me feel like a queen: satisfying my savory fixation and ending with the French toast as a dessert. 

The décor is faux industrial with exposed pipes, minimalist metallic tables, and red metal chairs but it works and it makes me feel like an-almost hipster chowing down inside a Brooklyn warehouse in Williamsburg. Or so I imagine because I'm really not that cool.  

Additionally it's just great value! I took a NYC friend there and she was like - wow you get twice the amount of food at half the price with the quality on par. Plus it's a BYOB!
