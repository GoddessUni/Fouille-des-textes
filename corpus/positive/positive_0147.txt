Update: I've been here three times in two weeks. Tried the #3 burrito today. It is wrapped in seaweed like a giant sushi roll. SOOOO GOOD!! 

My new go-to lunch spot. Set up like Chipotle, you order at the register and can either choose from one of their menu suggestions or make your own sushi burrito/bowl. The price is equivalent to one specialty roll anywhere else ($11.99-$13.99) but so much more food! Start with choosing white or brown rice. Then select your protein: raw tuna, spicy tuna, salmon, spicy Salmon, crab delight, octopus. Next you choose other ingredients like cucumbers, ginger, avocado, fish eggs, carrots, onion, etc. The last thing you do is pick a sauce: spicy mayo, teriyaki, soy, sweet chili, eel, and a topping like sesame seeds, tempura crunch, walnut flakes. 

Customer service was excellent, wait time very short and food fresh. Will be back on a weekly basis!
