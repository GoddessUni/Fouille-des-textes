At Cena channelside with my girlfriend from work. We had the most delicious appetizer with cheeses, italian meats, fig jam, dijon mustard, fancy marcona almonds and more ... along with the warm sliced italian baguette & olive oil. I had a glass of bubbly (only $5 a glass) and Judy drank an interesting beer. To top everything off we had cappuccinos and a TO-Die-For tiramisu. I highly suggest this as a date night or a girls get-together. PS don't trust the google map or your gps - they will both take you to the wrong Nebraska left turn... call them and they will direct you.
