First time went to the Night Market- it was from Chinatown. 

Before we ordered food, we ventured out on what other food there is. There's a few cupcake food trucks. When we were going home by 8pm, the "say cheese' food truck is still not open. I'm curious on how good is their grilled cheese. did they ever opened??

We got there early when some vendors are still trying to set up! 
We tried the shortribs tacos from Guapos- chef jose garces- it was ok for 1 taco $5 i think it's just over rated. I'd rather go to his restaurants than the food truck. It was great seeing his food truck there though.

Magu - japanese pancake- $5 for 5 balls of pancake size of the meatballs. and waited at least 20 mins for the very long line.

Crepewalk- i had banana nutella crepe. I took it home. I wish they put more nutella. Overall I would go back to order more crepe. The service is so slow though and there was even no line when we got there. (i told you we were there early like 6:30pm)
