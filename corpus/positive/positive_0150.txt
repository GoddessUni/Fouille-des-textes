Silver Peak is the SPOT to hang out with friends/family. It is perfectly located and has a great energy. My only complain is that they change their menu pretty often. Although I like changes I also like when a place has its unique food. I think they need to have a meal that doesn't always involve pasta or jambalaya. I enjoy eating good and tasty food. They used to have this curry coconut shrimp with straw mushrooms that was delicious but, they took from the menu twice and as you can tell I did not like it..hehe...Every time I go there I ask for it even though it is not on the menu hoping that they will remember me and put it back on the menu again. =D
Besides that I have all good things to talk about this place.

* They have now a Caipirinha drink that was delicious (Its a different version of the Brazilian Caipirinha)
