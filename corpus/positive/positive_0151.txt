One of the best grocery stores I have ever been in.  It is like a mix between whole foods and a Costco or bjs.  Not in that you could buy items in bulk or that it was warehouse looking but, that it had more items than you could ever imagine... It was freaking huge.  They had lots of organic items and gluten free sections just like you would expect from a whole foods type of store which is awesome because you can get a lot of organic items and such without a huge price tag because it isnt a specialty store.  Also because it isn't a specialty store you can get regular items for shopping like razors and such and not be paying these huge price tags.  The cashiers were never ending.  Most stores you go to there are maybe 10 check out with 3 people working it was completely different here.  There were 20 something lanes and I think every single one had a cashier.  There were no lines although the store was crowded which is always a major plus.  The parking lot is huge as well so you will never not be able to find a spot.  The best part about the experience is that form the second you walked into the store you got this strong but not overpowering smell of fresh cinnamon.  I know it sounds weird but, it was really awesome it was throughout the store so i guess they decided to pipe it through the air vents or something but honestly i caught that smell and i was sold I didn't want to leave.  Now that I think about it maybe that is their secret plan to get people to come in and never leave and maybe all those cashiers were once just regular customers that never left.  HMMMMMM interesting well anyway yeah go there get some awesome stuff and go on simple as that.
