This is my favorite restaurant in Boise.  I invite a lot of travelling in coworkers to come here for a great experience. I am really surprised to not see the potatoes au gratin on here, because they are to DIE for.  Love them.  Some of the other reviews mentioned mosquitos.  The tavern is in BOISE.  By the BOISE RIVER.  That's where mosquitos are.  Don't eat outside, and you won't have that issue.  I have had their sushi, their nachos, steak, salmon, ahi tuna.  I would go just for their potatoes, though. And you don't get an atmosphere like this anywhere else in Boise.
