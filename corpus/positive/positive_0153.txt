My family and I went to Pizza Brain this past weekend, while visiting my younger brother in Phili.  He recommended we walk over to this place.  We had no expectations and had never heard of it before.

If you look at everything inside closely, you will see that almost every piece of furniture and parts of the walls have something interesting about them.  The countertops are made from the backs of pianos.  Aside from it being a unique looking place, the owner and staff were so friendly.  You can clearly see that they are enthusiastic about running a restaurant and are truly appreciative of their customers. 

We ordered 3 pies, 2 Janes and one white pie with carmelized onions.  While eating, we were asked several times if everything was ok.  The staff and owner took the time to walk over to the ice cream place, where we were eating, just to ask.  Their hard work and pride really shows.

The crust on the pizza was good and crispy.  However, the pizzas just had too much garlic for our tastes.  The garlic flavor overwhelmed the other flavors in the pizza.  Maybe it was just a strong batch of garlic that day??  The cheese was not gooey, which is our preference.

That said, though, I would go back just to support the owner, and perhaps ask them to go a little easier on the fresh garlic.
