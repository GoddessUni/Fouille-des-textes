I'm surprised by some of the recent reviews that suggested the service was off - we recently went with a six and nearly fell in love with our server: she quickly figured us out, helped with recommendations and kept us appropriately marinated.
This place is a classy neighborhood restaurant - the kind you'd bring home to mother. It is not pretentious, but more tongue-in-cheek; the dishes appeal to the foodie who craves variations from tried-and-true, but not to the extent that one embarks on a exploration on the level of Lewis-and-Clark (or worse, Donner-Reed). 
Step 1: order any cocktail, preference for any daily special.
Step 2: order anything that incorporates duck fat, bacon or truffle oil.
Step 3: Enjoy!
