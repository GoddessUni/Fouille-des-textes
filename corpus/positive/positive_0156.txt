My boyfriend has always wanted to try this place out. It's overshadowed by Hooters & has a modest store front with just its name. Once we entered I could see that this was just a little hole in the wall, but I instantly loved the atmosphere. It's a pretty intimate setting with a sushi bar area that was super cool! My boyfriend ordered the curry &
I ordered the Ramen. We also got a sunshine roll. Both the entrees came with a salad. This was topped with carrots, ginger & soy sauce & was delicious. His also came with miso soup. The sunshine roll came out shortly after. I really liked that this place gives you a menu that explains what's in each roll to help you know exactly what you're getting. My boyfriend said he liked the curry a lot & the bite I had was great. My ramen wasn't as rich as I'd like it to be. The miso broth just could have been more rich. I'd give it 7/10 as my egg wasn't soft boiled either. All and all though I really enjoyed this restaurant & the food we ate, especially the sushi & the salad. The atmosphere made me feel like we were in some Japanese restaurant in New York.
