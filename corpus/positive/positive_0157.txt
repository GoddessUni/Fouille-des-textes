Oh, Arena Liquor, you are always there when I don't want to go out and pay bar prices or wear anything other than sweatpants.  And you have so many choices for me to play "just pick the prettiest bottle or box" with.  I am so glad you are so close to my house. 

It isn't very big, but the selection is surprisingly good and the staff is friendly.  There is always something that catches your eye when you are going to pick up whatever it was that you came for and the prices are pretty reasonable so getting both is probably a good idea.    

I am the biggest fan of all the tiny airplane bottles by the register.  I like that you can try something and not have a bunch left if it turns out to be disgusting.  I also love them because they are the perfect amount for the baking that I do that requires something that I would never normally purchase.  

Next time you are in the area, or just want to play alcohol roulette, don't forget to stop in!
