Food was very good, wine list not so much.  My wife and daughter had the chicken piccata, my other daughter the apple fritter and fried brie salad, and I had the lamb chops, all great.  For dessert, the girls has this chocolate desert which they loved.  Wine by the glass is another story.  For Chardonnay, your choice is a cheap MacMurray ranch, for $10/glass, which you can buy in any grocery store for about $9/bottle, and that is the only Chard available.  I guess they want to sell bottles of wine, but you can't have a taste, you have to buy blind.  They had a wonderful Alma Rosa Pinot listed for a very reasonable $38/bottle, only problem is they didn't have the wine in stock.  And by the way, there is no hard liquor here, so don't go expecting a martini.  Good ambiance and service, but there is no excuse for such a poor wine list in wine country.
