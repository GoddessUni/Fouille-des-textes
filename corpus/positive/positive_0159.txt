Amazing little restaurant in Hyde Park. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is very inviting. I have had a few cronuts there and they are beyond delicious, think of homemade donuts but with a airier texture and much larger. 

The only menu item I have ever ordered is the American burger, odd that it is a French restaurant but let me say this burger rocks. 100% Lean grass fed beef and it is delicious. The meat is just dripping when you bite into it. They put the burger on a really well matched bun, very rustic and delicious. It comes with cheese and some very good bacon. Arugula lettuce and fresh tomatoes and a side of fries and house pickles.

This burger will change your life, you will crave it every time you visit Hyde park so I warn you in advance.
