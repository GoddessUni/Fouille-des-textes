I joined a group of friends for Soul Food Sunday and was not disappointed. The location itself is very inviting and interesting to look at. I ordered a cider to drink, but was disappointed with my choice when I realized they had a large list of unique specialty drinks. I talked my boyfriend into getting the whiskey sweet tea drink and it was so delicious. A few of my tablemates got their bloody Ella with the spare rib and enjoyed it. 
I had already decided that I was definitely getting the BBQ mushroom sandwich with the vegan mac and cheese. It was sooo good and a lot of food. I think next time I will get the same thing but maybe just get the BBQ mushrooms without the bun so I don't carb overload.
