I'm a bit discerning when it comes to eating out, and this little gold mine caught me pleasantly by surprise. Hidden in the middle of a strip mall on Broadway and Kolb, this place is firing on all cylinders! Casual cafe with a gourmet menu and cafe prices. My wife enjoyed the Coyote Benedict and I had the Emperor Benedict - jalape√±o tamale cakes with juicy steak, shrimp, poached eggs, and a chipotle sauce (I'm missing listing all the yummy features). The hash browns were crispy without the extra grease and coffee gourmet like. Complimentary snicker doodle pancakes! We will be back!
