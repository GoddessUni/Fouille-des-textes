Yum! Have heard amazing things about cafe lift and finally got to come try. I had off on a Friday and thought this was the perfect time to come check it out.

Very low key vibe which I love. Wooden tables and rustic feel. Was kind of busy but service was quick and amazing. I struggled what to get but decided on the very unique croque madam which was on special (along with coffee, of course). This did not disappoint! HUGE slices of sourdough bread sandwiched in ham and gruyere, with bechamel and an over easy egg. Came with a side of breakfast potatoes which were nice and seasoned and a bit crispy on the outside. Brought half home and was just as good later!

Can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!
