While my new wife and I were driving to California, we wanted to stop and get some hot kosher food (2 days of sandwiches and nuts were not cutting it.)  We realized that we would be arriving at 5th street just prior to closing, so we called ahead and they kept the hot case items there for us.  We arrived just moments before they were going to close and ordered some of their delicious food.  They then invited us to hang out inside the restaurant to eat (even though they had closed.)  They sat with us and we had a great conversation.  They treated us like family, giving us samples of other foods to try, and even insisted on making us coffees to drink before we headed out on the road again.  

What an amazing place.  I am looking forward stopping there on our return trip.
