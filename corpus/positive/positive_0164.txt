A full service restaurant at PHL? A RARITY now that they've replaced just about most places with those stupid tablets where you're not allowed to interact with a server. (Can you tell I'm not a fan as a business traveler?) Not only does Bud and Marilyn's have servers and a full bar, but they are doing a great job working the area with staffers who are pleasant and helpful. They have a great assortment of cocktails, beers and wines for the thirsty, and some awesome fried chicken and burger options if you're looking for a bite. I had chicken tenders and fries which were about the same as I would've paid at chick fil a ($9.99). I wasn't in the mood for anything too heavy or I would've loved to try the fried chicken sandwich - next time! Side note, the couple next to me kept commenting that they felt like this was the freshest "airport burger" they've ever had and were super happy with their meal. Will have to remember that for next time too!! 

If you're a reviewer who wants to complain about service, then go talk to a tablet somewhere else. Bud and Marilyn's was quaint and enjoyable. For bonus points, they also have two nice TVs in the bar area so you don't have to miss the game while wining and dining with a good meal before your flight. 

Cheers!
