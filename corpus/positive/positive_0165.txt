Love Krispy Kreme donuts! This location isn't the best if they're not fresh but it is a local go to. They usually have all the classics - original glazed, cream filled, raspberry filling, chocolate frosted, strawberry frosted and apple filled. 

They have a great selection of iced coffees and lattes that are pretty good. I was pretty disappointed that they wouldn't accept my YELP coupon for a free donut. I had the voucher for checking in but apparently they're not affiliated with YELP. 

Definitely would return, can't wait to enjoy my donuts now! Enjoy your visit!!!
