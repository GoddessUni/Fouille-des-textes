In a world where there's a Starbucks on every corner (almost literally in some places), it always warms my heart to see an independent coffee shop.  Cafe Ole is just such a place.  Located on 3rd Street, north of Market, this place serves coffee, tea, healthy pre-made sandwiches and salads, fruit, desserts, etc.  You can park yourself at a table outside while enjoying their wireless internet (which won't be much of a novelty soon, since Philly is going completely wireless), or you can sit indoors and enjoy the local artwork, friendly staff, and independent ambiance.  Personally, I think Starbucks' coffee is bitter - like burned dirt - so I prefer the coffee at Cafe Ole.  Or any independent coffee shop.  Or Wawa for that matter.  But my coffee tastes aside, this is a great little place to enjoy a cup 'o joe and a good book or good conversation.  Ole!
