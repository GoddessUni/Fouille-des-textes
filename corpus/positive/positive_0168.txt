Went for a Friday late lunch; party of 3.  First time here.  The waiter was efficient and friendly.  Food came out quickly after we ordered.
I had a caesar salad and grouper bites appetizer.  Perfect sized lunch meal; all food was tasty and filling.  
My wife had the small salmon dish with cole slaw and carrots.  She loved it.  My friend had the spinach salad with grilled shrimp.  All plates were emptied at the table.
The decor is old Florida-by-the-sea.  A weathered wood exterior, driftwood door handles, etc. make it inviting and comfortable like an old shoe.  It was quiet enough to have conversation even though there were plenty of diners.
We will be back.
