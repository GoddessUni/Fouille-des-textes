My husband and I had dinner tonight at Ukiyo and it was the best restaurant experience we have had in Indianapolis in a long time! We started with the crab fat fried rice, which was amazing. It was full of flavor and big lumps of crab meat. We then got the ramen and the tuna flight, both of which tasted fresh and had great flavor. Our only criticism was that the pork in the ramen was a little thick and chewy. The old fashioned I had was also incredibly good. I often order an old fashioned at restaurants and it was nice to try one that was unique but not so different that it seemed like a completely different cocktail. We will definitely be returning to this restaurant soon!!
