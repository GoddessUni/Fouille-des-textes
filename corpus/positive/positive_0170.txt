This is another spot we went to a few years ago when we went to NOLA. At that time, it was newly opened by a guy from the Bay area. 

We had good food and service there then, so we went back this trip.  It was pretty busy the night we went because of the basketball playoffs. We just wanted to get a bite to eat. Their menu seemed a to have been revised to just the basics (burgers and wings) which kind of disappointed me because I remembered they had some good items last time. However, the wings were great. They were very peppery and they came with fries. Local beers on tap, which also makes me happy and they came out pretty quickly despite it being a busy night.

We ate downstairs, but they have an upstairs with a balcony. They also have sidewalk seating. Also, my husband and I both noted that their restroom were very clean. I know, a funny thing to mention but a lot of places in the quarter do not have clean restrooms.

I think we would go back again on our next trip too!
