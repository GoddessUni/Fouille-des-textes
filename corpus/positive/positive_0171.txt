Love H & I's!! Fun and upscale with professional servers and amazing food! 

First time at this location downtown but have been to the northern one many times. For the appetizer we ordered the calamari and it was fantastic. The sauce that comes with it has a little extra bit of kick! 

For the main course I had to try something new, and not steak for once, so I ordered the fettuccine Alfredo with a salmon and boy was that the best decision I've ever made. 

The rich and creamy pasta came out topped with a perfectly cooked fillet of salmon. Absolutely melted in my mouth! My husband got his favorite steak which I can't remember but it was supposed to be medium and it was straight extra rare. He even had then take it back and it was still rare the second time :/ abnormal service for sure. 

For dessert a couple of us shared the woodford reserved bread pudding and vanilla ice cream: to die for!
