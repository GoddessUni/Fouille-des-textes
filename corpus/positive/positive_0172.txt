This hands down the best Vietnamese food I've ever had.  My in-laws live in the area, and I make sure to make my way to Vietnam Cafe every single visit.  The summer rolls are just bursting with deliciousness and the the lemongrass chicken (#46) is without equal.  The shrimp bun (#25) is also very nice, as is the grilled chicken. The ambience is just okay, and the service can be so so, but the food is just *incredible*.  I once had my in-laws bring me 6 orders of #46 when they made a road trip to Boston near my birthday.  I was in heaven!  

I honestly don't understand how this place isn't packed every single night.
