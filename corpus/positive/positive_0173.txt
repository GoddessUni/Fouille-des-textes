Can ice cream be elegant?

I think it can - so I submit to you, that Little Baby's Ice cream serves up some seriously elegant ice cream.  Get yourself some!  Gourmet and innovative flavors - that don't whack you over the head.  

I do declare that a scoop each of Peanut Butter Maple Tarragon and Balsamic Banana is the new modern mix equivalent of a basic childhood favorite, but with twice the flavor and depth.

Not to mention. Speculoos.  Oh, Speculoos. Be still my beatin' heart!

Delicious treat for a hot summer day.  (oh, and guess what? They've not got their own little brick and mortar store - aside from the trucks - right in Fishtown)
