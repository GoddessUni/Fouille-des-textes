Super nice new digs on the West Bank for desserts and breakfast!

The new building complex is huge and gorgeous and super spacious!!!  I love the fact that parking is behind the building so the experience is slow-paced and relaxed, none of that hustle and bustle!

Parrot Pete's is really nice inside, great tables all spaced adequately with those Carribean-esque wicker chairs.  the magazines on display are for purchase, no reading!  So definitely not a Barnes and Nobles experience.  The layout is a bit confusing though.  When you enter, head straight and you will hit a dessert case.  Turn right to purchase your icecreams/milkshakes.  

But more than likely you will get dessert and a cup of joe.  Coffee here...$2!!!  It's a good brew, although a bit watery for my tastes.  Had the berry cake...it was delicious!  Yellow cake w/ a whipped topping with blueberries and strawberries..it was moist and absolutely delicious - not sweet at all!  love it...friend had lemon bar..it was okay.  fountain drinks - $2.00!!!  my gosh!  they totally get you on drinks!

The prices for the desserts are a bit steep - a mini wedding cake was $6.00!!!  A slice of cake - $5.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  My goodness!  

Breakfast here starts @ 8.00....lunch will definitely run you at least $15!  But the environment is relaxed and the workers seem to be so happy.  Haven't tried foods yet, but the specialty at Parrot Pete's is the Kitchen Sink...a huge icecream sundae meant for sharing w/ lots of folks, served in a huge bowl w/ a "faucet" and "taps". ...the kids faces totally lit up - very cute..up to the point they got their sugar rush and put their mouths on everything (eww).

I'd be back here for brunch..it's nice, it's clean, the workers/cooks seem genuinely happy...that's always a plus!  Not sure if there is WI-FI available..but a few folks had laptops out...
