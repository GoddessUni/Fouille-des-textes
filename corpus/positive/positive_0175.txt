For a hotel bar - 360 is pretty cool.

I think the first thing that hits you about 360 is that it just feels... swanky. From the great view, to the outdoor fireplaces, to the high ceilings (and DJ strung up in the middle of the ceiling) - the swank factor is high everywhere.

Though it tends to be fairly busy, somehow tables seem to make themselves available if you are a little patient. It is interesting to me that the patrons tend to self segregate by skin color. Never seen that before, but it's at least nice that it's more diverse than many places in STL.

Table service tends to be pretty decent, drinks are pretty good, and prices are a bit steep (but not offensively so). I hear rumors that the food is good but I haven't had a chance to sample it myself.

Definitely my favorite memory here is the impromptu dance off. I thought that stuff only happened in movies.

They sometimes charge cover (weak sauce), and you can valet your car for a fairly low fee (I think $4?). However, there is typically street parking within a block, so you can save your $4.

If they could lower prices and get rid of cover (have I mentioned that I effing hate cover?) I think we could talk about raising them to a 5* establishment. Until then, 4* it is.
