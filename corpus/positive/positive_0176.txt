Let me first say that I live about an hour away from this location and will most likely live farther from the others.. BUT this does not stop me! I am absolutely in LOVE WITH TIM HORTONS!!! I come about 3 times a week, and I know I will be coming more often when school starts so I can study and drink my delicious coffee and doughnuts for a cheap price! Tim Hortons -- STL has wonderful prices on both coffee, doughnuts and meals. Tim Hortons is similar to a bread co by the food/drink choices, but it is way cheaper and in my opinion way better. I've recommended Tim Hortons to my friends and so far they love it! I am looking forward for the next locations!! 
Oh let me also note I love how this location is open 24 hours! 24 hours people! Not only do I get to enjoy a bit of Canada but I get to enjoy it whenever I want. For those of you that don't know.. Tim Hortons originates in Canada, and it is very popular there.. Like literally they are everywhere like the McD's here. I am betting that other states would just love to have Tim Hortons..& maybe other states will get them, I know a few already have them. But I am so happy to say that my city has them! 

I will also note: yes this location may be kinda small.. But come on people it's their first location, I'm assuming the other 24/7 shops will either be the same size or a bit bigger.. But people it's about the food and the drinks. Like you are having a bite of Canada.. Chill out, and enjoy!!! 

To all of you haters out there who took the time to write your mean reviews... Give it another chance! They just opened a few months ago.. They were also new to the place, but give it another try! And for some reason if it still doesn't satisfy your needs.. Then fine.. Go enjoy your $6.00 small coffee at Starbucks. While your there.. I know I'll be enjoying my small coffee for around $1.00 maybe a little more, but mine will be better.. And Oooh I'll be enjoying it 24/7!!! ;D
