This place was recommended by some locals and I'm so happy I met them because this food was sooooooooo good ; I can't wait to return. 

The presentation was everything as you can see but it was like this for everyone's meal that came by us. And the taste was unforgettable. JUST GO! 

Stephanie was great and checked in and also the girl with the Hogwarts tattoo was really nice and helpful as well. Overall the staff are wicked nice and I couldn't get a enough. 

Thank you all so much for a great experience and warm atmosphere!

Oh this place is also CASH ONLY! And they have an atm if you don't make it this far!
