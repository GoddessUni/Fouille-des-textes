We've been meaning to head over here for the last four years or so, and so glad that we did tonight! Even though we've lived in the area for years, we still rarely venture to any businesses or restaurants under the El, so it took us a while to actually go ahead and try Thang Long. 

We usually head down to Pho Ha on Washington St. for our pho fix, but my 39-weeks-pregnant wife came down with a cold and was craving pho during the snow today, so I called over to Thang Long around 7:15pm to see if they were still open. Thankfully, they were! It was much bigger than it would seem to be from the outside, quite a few tables. My wife got the chicken pho, I got the beef - first time there, wanted to try the basics. Thankfully, they offered my wife with bone & skin or with just white meat (we had a friend who went here who said the bones & skin mostly just got in the way), so she picked just white meat. 

What can I say? Excellent pho! The broth was delicious, the ingredients on the add-in plate were fresh and tasty, the beef was really good, and the chicken was delicious. The chicken even came with a plate of "dipping sauce" (basically seasoned salt) to help flavor the chicken even more if you desire. 

Service was friendly, but certainly not what you would call attentive. We ordered hot tea that never came, but we didn't get charged for it and we were so into eating our pho we didn't bother trying to track someone down to get our tea. Good prices, friendly faces - they even take cards ($15 minimum, which you won't meet if you get two standard phos). While we were there, two good friends of ours came in and got takeout pho, which is an interesting concept (we only ever eat it in the restaurant), so we might try that soon.
