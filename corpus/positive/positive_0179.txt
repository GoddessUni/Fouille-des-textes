Told my mom I was eating vegan donuts and though her initial reaction was negative, I was gleaming! My friend is trying to be vegan once a week to try new things and get into the mindset more often, and these treats were the perfect way to start the day. We got a sampling of 3 donuts (peanut chew, boston cream in the shape of a heart, cookie crumble) and also the pear muffin! 

As for the donuts, amazing. Donut texture with delicious frosting, especially the cookie one we got. It was covered in cookie dough and oreo crumbles and the chocolate frosting all made me feel like I was eating a high end, creamy, guilt-inducing dessert. The boston cream was the same frosting but with an interesting filling, which was almost exactly like a regular cream filling but slightly thinner. The peanut chew is for the PB lover, drizzled with maple or caramel and a really really sweet overall taste. 

The muffin was dense but so lightly sweet, it complemented the donuts we got perfectly. You could tell it was fresh by the pear legitimately in the muffin, and the crumble top was a perfect crunch at the top of every bite. Plus it was huge! And I topped it off with an almond milk hot coco which kept me warm and happy! 

Will be coming back to try the huge fritters.
