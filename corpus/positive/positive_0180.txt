A restaurant made out of money?!! YES! The exterior of this place is covered with pennies, apparently all the pennies on the walls worth over $1000. Very interesting design, the seating area is super hipster, it gives you a back yard garden kind of feel. Nice to enjoy a pizza or tea. 

LOCATION- Located in this little courtyard made out of Lucky Penny and The Lark

FOOD- we ordered the mushroom pizza to share, IT WAS THE BOMB! So yummy, and very hot (be careful) 
         Kombucha - a fermented tea, very interesting, got the flavor of the tea and at the same time you can taste the fermentation. Super good for hangovers!

OVERALL - lover the ambiance, the food, and the drinks here, and the people who work here are super chill and nice! I would come to Santa Barbara again to just visit this place and the LARK
