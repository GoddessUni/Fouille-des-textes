First time going to this dinner which was recommended by two of my coworkers and my husband LOVED IT! which he lived in Alabama for 5yrs has been craving biscuit sausage gravy platter for the longest! That being said he had to order it since it was one of the platters listed on there menu! Not only was the pricing great but it was big and satisfying! Alberto the manager was great and friendly along with our waiter Zac! 
Thanks again for the great experience! 
& the chefs in the back for the flavorful food! 
My daughter also enjoyed her meal left the plate almost clean, not to mention kids drinks are free! 
Homemade fries is a must when you go!
