Been wanting to try this place since it opened. Upscale Mexican in St Phillips Plaza. By the same folks who operate Union public House across the way. Modern SW interior with nice outdoor seating overlooking the plaza. We went to celebrate our wedding anniversary and we were not disappointed. Nice wine selection, full bar and local craft brews on tap. Chips and tangy red sauce were provided. We also got the guacamole. A very ample and tasty serving for two. Ceviche appetizer. My bride loves ceviche, we both thought it was of the best ceviche ever. Entrees were the fish special for her, a perfectly cooked sea bass on a spicy bed of greens and carnitas for me. We ordered the calabasitas for the side and the Cherri's and chocolate for desert. Calories be damned. It was delish! Our server was helpful and attentive. Well done you guys!
