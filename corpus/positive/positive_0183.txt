This is one crazy dive! Don't remember what night we were here (New Orleans right?) Got Monsoons at Port of Call- best drink in New Orleans btw. Wait for table was hour and half so we got our monsoons to go. Ended up at Clover Grill. I've had this place on my go to list for a couple years. Husband got the biscuits and gravy and loved them. I opted for burger with cheese (me: can I get that medium? Cook: no)! I have no idea what our son-in-law had but he was pretty happy. We sat at counter and was fun watching the guys cooking and the hub cap thing cracked me up.
