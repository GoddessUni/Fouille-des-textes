My new favorite place. I'm so excited I found this establishment. BBQ is my favorite type of food, so I'd been wanting to come here for a while! The restaurant itself is unpretentious; come as you are for a delicious meal. My group and I enjoyed the BBQ fries with pulled chicken, and they were to die for. Only thing is the fries could have used a bit more chicken. I also loved the cornbread waffle - it's even better without the honey and butter, so you can really taste the cornbread flavor! Really wanted to try the Sweet Southern Mess (sweet potato fries with an assortment of toppings) but it was unavailable when I went. All in all, I loved it, and I can't wait to go back. Oh - and it's BYOB. Big plus!
