The five stars is ONLY for the food! The customer service was annoying and rude. I was greeted w/ a "May I help you?" Rude as hell. I had to adjust my attitude before I responded. The lady responded again w/ a "Welcome to Popeye's, how may I help you?" By the time, I was already over it. The face I was greeted with at the window didn't make it any better. However! When I got home, I opened my box and was pleased. My food was hot and fresh, although I was expecting the worst based off of the customer service.
