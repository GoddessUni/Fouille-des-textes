The food here is fine, it's on par with other California Tortilla locations I've visited over the years. The hot sauce wall is of course great and the service is good. Inside is pretty clean, although it always feels empty no matter how many other people are eating there. I suppose that's a good thing.

I really do love the burrito elito rewards club. Every so many dollars you spend, you get perks, and there are birthday perks as well. You have to download the app which is a bit odd but it works, and I like free, tasty food.

You can combo your food with a drink and chips/dip for about $11-$12 ish, which is great. You'll never leave here on an empty stomach, and the ingredients are a bit different than what you'd find at Chipotle or other counter service burrito joint. They do use lettuce in a lot of their food which is fine, I'm not crazy over it but it works for them and doesn't taste half bad. 

Don't forget the free WiFi! I like eating here and I will continue to come here.
