I visited Sweet Tomaotes Friday evening and was pleasantly surprised at the variety of foods and drinks that they offer. You come in the door and can start loading your plate with various pre-made salads such as potato salad or Greek salad with feta cheese. You can also build your own from the many, many options the salad bar has to offer. All the components I selected were fresh and well-presented. (I had checked the Florida Department of Business and Professional Regulation before I came, and felt the restaurant had received good inspection ratings. I don't go to a restaurant until I check this out first.) There was a bakery area with cornbread, rolls, multigrain bread and focaccia breads. The garlic-cheese focaccia was to die for! There were several soups to choose from, including vegan, vegetarian and meat choices. The tomato basil was as tasty as any I have had in other restaurants. They also offer two pasta dishes including some very good macaroni and cheese like you remember from your childhood, made with American cheese. The lemonade was especially good as was the pineapple upside-down cake. All in all, for the price, Sweet Tomatoes is a healthy and tasty bargain with something for everyone. Sweet Tomaotes was clean-looking and food seemed to be updated regularly.
