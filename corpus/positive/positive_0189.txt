We had absolutely a perfect evening at the restaurant. We had Donovan for a waiter. He could not have been more attentive and very knowledgable of everything that they serve at the restaurant. He had great suggestions for us to try. And try we did !  Our 25 year old grandson joined us and he especially liked his recommendations for drinks.
The French onion soup was the best and the salads (the shrimp and lobster and wedge were delicious and huge. 
The women had lobster and the men had steak done to perfection -medium plus.. The lobster mac, creamed corn, and hashbrowns which were served family style were stellar.  We finished with pure decadence as we ordered baked Alaska, icebox lemon pie, and chocolate fudge cake. 
Valet parking was a great amentity and the car was waiting when we left. 

A fantastic dining experience.
