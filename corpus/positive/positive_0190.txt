While in Santa Barbra, I wanted to make sure we visited as many highly rated shops & restaurants as possible.

French Press received one of the top spots within the vicinity we were looking to explore.  I do enjoy a good cup of coffee every now and then and my husband drinks coffee everyday.

I ordered a decaf since I'm pregnant and my husband ordered the House Special.  I thought the coffee was rich, smooth, medium roast and good.  My husband didn't care for their coffee.

Later that day, I was having a hankering for something sweet and iced cold.  We returned and I ordered their Homemade Lemonade which hit the spot though a bit on the too-sugar-y side for me.  I just diluted it with water and wah-lah!  Half cup of lemonade is a full cup of lemonade again!

I personally think French Press is worth a visit.
