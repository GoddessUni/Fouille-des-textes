Inside Reading Terminal Market there's no shortage of food stalls. There's no shortage of sandwich joints. There's no shortage of corned beef or pastrami.

If you are looking for the self-proclaimed, "the best Jewish deli outside New York" then Hershel's is your destination.

As I was fighting the packed crowds inside the market I found Hershel's and the line went around the corner. I jumped in and I was surprised how fast it moved- only 20 minutes from entering the line to being handed my meal.

Here's what I got:

Rueben Pastrami: In true NYC deli fashion, it was large and in charge. A fantastic combination of flavors from the freshly baked rye and its aromas of anise to the well-seasoned pastrami combined with swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing all in perfect proportions that allowed the meat to be the star of the show. 

Potato Latkes: At first I questioned why only three per order but when I saw the size I realized it was more than enough! Thick yet crispy, I enjoyed them with some sour cream (you can get it with apple sauce too.)

Jewish Apple Cake: On the surface, it didn't look like it was going to be very moist but the large slice was perfectly baked inside. Not very sweet but a great end to a very big meal.

Hershel's is worth the wait and after a meal that big, worth the nap afterward.
