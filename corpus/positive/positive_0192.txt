I am vascillating between three and four stars here....I wish there were halves!  The first time I came here was for dinner with a large group.  The menu seemed small and I had the pork tenderloin medallions.  They were REALLY good.  The wait staff just kind of left us alone, which is fine.  Plus it's BYOB which we love.  

The second time was for lunch with some co-workers.  I'm not kidding, the fig/brie spread was awesome.  I wanted to lick my plate and fought with my boss over who got the last bites.  So good.  

In fact, it was so good that I don't remember what I ate for lunch that day...I remember enjoying it, but the figs.  My god, the figs.

The wait staff seemed aloof again.  I am starting to think maybe it's just their deal.  But it's cute, decorated great, and gives a great view of the Quarter from the front dining room.  

A little pricey, but worth a try if you're in the area.
