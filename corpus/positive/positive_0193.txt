Great food, good coffe, and a beautiful location just across from the Anheuser Busch brewery. I stopped in for breakfast, and my Benton Park Slinger (biscuits, bacon, gravy and eggs) definitely hit the spot and miraculously cured my hangover. However, I was burdened with a belly full of food... Tasty, glorious food.

That was served with loaded hash browns, which were just hash browns, sour cream, chives and a bit of cheese. That was kind of lackluster, but it's hard to meet perfection.

My service was decent. I simply ordered at the counter, so I really didn't get the full experience. I saw people on the patio enjoying a Saturday morning with waiter service, so I think it might be standard.

Parking is a bit of an issue. I hate walking more than a block to get breakfast, but I think Benton Park Coffee is worth it.
