My wife is at Renown so I went through the drive thru on my way home.  The young woman order taker was polite.  My food came out correct, hot & tasted freshly made.  She made sure there was teriyaki sauces and told me they were freshly made and very hot.  When I got home 1/2 later the food was still hot and very good.

I've returned 3 times since all at different times.  Each time I used the drive thru.  Every time the woman order taker was friendly.  I saw that she opened my order to make sure it was correct each time as well.

My wife will be in the hospital for a few more days and I plan on going here again.
