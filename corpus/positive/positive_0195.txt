9 Mile Garden is a welcome addition to the Affton neighborhood. 9MG brings together so many things that help make St. Louis a great place into one unique spot; from local beer to excellent food trucks, you can't go wrong with a stop at 9 Mile Garden.

When you first arrive, you will notice The Canteen, which provides limited indoor seating and a small patio, and a bar serving up some local drinks. Next, you will notice the large open area as well as the hill that provides more than enough space to spread out with friends or family after you pick out that perfect meal; best of all, you can catch up on the Cardinals (or Blues) game on the big screen too!

The most important part of 9 Mile Garden is their rotating selection of local food trucks; there is always something for everyone. My favorite food truck has to be Red Dirt Revival; however, you will never have to worry about what to eat when visiting 9MG. There are usually anywhere from 4-6 trucks available, so the selection is never a problem.

My only complaint is that parking can be tricky during peak times, pay attention to where you park, and be respectful of neighboring businesses.
