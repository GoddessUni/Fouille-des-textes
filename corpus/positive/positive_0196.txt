I really, really, dig on Ernesto's.

I've actually been there about 2~3 times now but I haven't written a review until today! The first couple of times I went, it was about 2 years ago with a guy friend and we just had some wine. No food. I didn't even know they had food! But I did hear a rumor about an awesome grilled cheese or something.

They only have one bathroom but it's suuuper cute and nice. Granite ledge by the mirror. Cute little candles. Hemmingway books for you to uh...read on the toilet? ;P Overall nice fixtures and lighting. Now that I am buying a home, I feel like I can finally appreciate expensive fixtures and building materials, hehehe.

The service is great here. Super fast and friendly. The menu is delicious...I have discovered this after going to the yelp gathering there yesterday! Theresa H.'s roasted red pepper soup looked mighty tasty so I had to order a cup for myself. It was SOOO good probably some of the best roasted red pepper soup I've ever had (sorry, Trader Joe's!) and it had a bit of cheese on top too. Mmm. Soo goood. Then I had a margherita flatbread and it was also quite tasty but not as good as some of the flatbreads that John H. ordered. 

Had some kind of raspberry lemonade martini and it ROCKED. Seriously, get you some! I was surprised it was so tasty because I figured Ernesto's was more of a wine place but it's awesome to see that they can rock martinis as well. Variety is good. It's what keeps me coming back to places.

And as for Ernesto's, I'll be back! Hopefully Sean would like their pizzas.
