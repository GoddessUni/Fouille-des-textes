There are three things in life these days that act as instant gustatory anti-depressants.  Imbibing or gormandizing any of these three, or even more importantly, in combination, results in the onset of a sensation of fulfillment and happiness in such a profound fashion that for a brief few minutes, I am left with the thought that all simply must be right in the world.   Of course this fades, which is great news for the owners of fine gastropubs such as Memphis Taproom.

What are these miracle, seratonin-releasing foods?  For me, they are great beer, pickles, and the more esoteric qualifier "fried".  MTR provides the most excellent trifecta of these items with their broad tap selection and their fried pickles.  If only man could live on fried pickles and beer alone, I would take up residence above this mecca of gastropubbery.  

Their dominance has recently been enhanced by the addition of their new outdoor space, with a different canned beer selection and assortment of hot dog varietals.  I can't recommend this place enough.
