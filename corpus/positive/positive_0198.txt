OH DUCHESS HOW I LOVE YOU! In the summer of 2009, I met, fell in love, and married my husband in Paris, France! He wasn't French, he was Egyptian. Typical me! I fell in love with Paris. Never thought I would. The derriere certainly had a love-hate relationship: pain au chocolat, baguette, fromage. You get the picture!

It wasn't until I finally arrived back in Edmonton in 2010, that I happened upon Duchess! It cured my Paris blues instantly! Even if you are not wanting to sample their fare, I dare you to at least take a look at what they have to offer. It certainly is ART for the senses. The French really do now how to treat food!

The pain au chocolat is my favourite, of course! You can choose between milk chocolat and dark. My preference is always dark. Other tasty treats that I have had the pleasure of devouring are the lemon meringue cake, their V-Day special ( I cannot even begin to describe this concoction), and DO NOT pass the savory! Their scones are to die for as well as  their tomato and bocconcini sandwich.

This is THE perfect place for a weekend escape. It transports you to France. The decor is, well, French, the staff is plentiful and helpful, and although their baked goods fly out of there in record breaking speed they always seem to have enough to go around.

And although the food looks like expensive art, it is totally affordable! 

Make every Sunday a Parisian Sunday in Edmonton! LOVE!
