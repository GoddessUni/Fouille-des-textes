Addie's Thai House... you have secured your spot as my favorite Thai restaurant in St. Louis. My wife loves Thai food, so what better way to celebrate her birthday than to try out a new Thai restaurant! (We had been hearing lots of great things about this place from some trusted sources, so we weren't going in blind.)

We made a reservation on a Saturday night, and I'm glad we did. The place was pretty busy, probably a 15-20 minutes for a table. The restaurant was very nicely decorated. From the Thai restaurants that I have been too, the decorations are usually really cheesy or there weren't decorations at all. Addie's did theirs with some class; the servers even dressed the part.

Normally, when my wife and I go to a Thai restaurant, one of us, if not both, end up getting the green curry. So my wife ordered the green curry, and I had the Waterfall Beef. I loved the Waterfall Beef. The charred beef with the fresh lime juice was such a great combination. I wouldn't think of putting lime on charred beef unless I was eating a taco.

For dessert, we decided on the Sticky Rice with Mango. I've never had this before, so I wasn't sure what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised. The dish was delicious and very refreshing! (I'll be ordering this again.)

Great Thai restaurant in St. Louis, check it out if you haven't already!
