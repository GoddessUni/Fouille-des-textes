Omg, finally a breakfast place with a huge selection, and they actually have breakfast skillets. Oh you may not understand the signifcance of breakfast skillets in my husband's world, but he was quite ecstatic. Must I be so exaggerating. Well, yelp brought me here based on the thread about good breakfasts. We hadn't been able to find that one, this one is pretty close. They have breakfast skillets, good selection of different types of breakfast items, outside seating that accepts our dog, and pretty good prices. They also have a funny theme inside with all of their decorations. I will be back there, and you should definitely try it.
