A world class beer bar with outstanding beer, a truly authentic atmosphere and fantastic food. I stop in whenever I'm in Philly and it's always the same. 

It's a small place that's often very  crowded so be prepared and try to get there early. I prefer the back room but if you can get a seat anywhere, take it.  The rarer beers are pricy so watch the menu closely but overall I think it's quite reasonable given the quality and location.

There are lots of great beer bars around  nowadays but Monk's helped set the mold and is still among the very best.
