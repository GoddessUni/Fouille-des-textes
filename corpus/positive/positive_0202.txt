Really, really good food! The server and hostess were both friendly, however it was a little bit slow. We sat outside on the patio and it was a great little space. 

I ordered the Lavender Lemonade cocktail, which was strong and tasted great. My boyfriend and I split the red mussels for an appetizer and it was one of the best orders of mussels we've had. I ordered the specials crab gravy pasta, which came with the casa salad and a dessert. All so delicious. The dressing on the salad was great. My boyfriend ordered the special surf n turf, which was steak and crab meat with a b√©chamel sauce on top of zucchini and potatoes. Incredible. For dessert we split the flourless chocolate torte cake, which was unique and flavorful.

All in all, I would definitely recommend. The only issue I noticed was that there was not much parking available. We ended up having to park in the "take-out" spots, which we didn't want to have to do, but there was no where else. It is also on a main road, so street parking it not an option.
