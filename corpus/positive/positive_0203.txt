Fantastic!!!

Our first visit and they didn't disappoint!
From the moment we walked in we felt like family. They opened the door for us as we walked in.

Our server (Max) was very attentive and helpful.  
Our food arrived promptly, was nicely presented and was a good amount of food for the value.
We started with the happy hour stuffed mushrooms and a couple of their Italian Peroni beers.  
For dinner we really enjoyed the Chicken Giovanni served with the house rice pilaf. 

At the end of our meal, we had the pleasure to meet the owner who is also the chief.  
Unlike many restaurants, while Max stopped by frequently to check on us, we didn't feel rushed and were able to enjoy a causal meal at this fine restaurant.

We will be a repeat customer and will recommend this restaurant to others.
