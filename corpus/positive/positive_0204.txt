This place knows soup. Every soup that I have ever tried here has been absolutely delicious. I typically come here for lunch and the wait isn't terrible. It's counter service with first come seating. I've tried the salad combos that have been fresh and cold as well. The only reason for 4 stars is WiFi seems available, but I don't see where the password is. Maybe I missed it? Staff is friendly and they hustle. Solid lunch 

Update: It's my go to lunch spot. Shout out to their staff. The friendliness of one particular employee made my Monday sooooo much better!
