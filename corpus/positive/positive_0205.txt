Vic is the best Sushi within a 30 minute drive.  Way better than Bluefin, and honestly on par with or superior to most places in the city.

Fresh fish, creative specialty rolls, and a Thai menu that would stand on its own.  But it's also the little things here - the friendly and accommodating staff, including Vic himself, who is the hardest working man in sushi I know, yet always looks up to wish you a good night.  The hundreds of pictures of satisfied customers on the walls tell you all you need to know about where this restaurant's priorities are.

Great for take-out or dining in (though there are only 6-8 tables and a few spots at the bar, so don't show up at 7:30 on a Friday evening expecting a quick seat).

It would take too long to list all the menu highlights, but do yourself a favor and try the Pad Kee Mao (Drunken Noodles)...it'll blow your hair back!
