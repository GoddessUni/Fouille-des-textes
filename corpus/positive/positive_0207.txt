I made a purposeful visit to this store after following them on Facebook for a while and seeing all the unique goodies they import. This store doesn't disappoint if you're looking for specialty candies, chocolates and drinks from other countries or from your childhood. I was hoping for jelly tots but they were sold out. In the end I left with a few different gummy candies and a couple chocolate bars and a rootbeer float. Price point is higher than other candy places but to be expected since they import almost all their edible goods. Service was friendly from the lady owner but it wasn't until I left and got home that I realized she forgot a couple of other gummy requests I had made. Also, the rootbeer float, while used quality ingredients, felt overpriced for the value. Once the initial foam wears off you're left with maybe 3/4 of a cup of float.
