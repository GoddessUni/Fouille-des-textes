This is my favorite Franklin breakfast, especially on the weekends. Get there early! The breakfast buffet is amazing. It's everything you want. You've got bbq scrambled eggs, pancakes, bread pudding, fruit, sausage, bacon, biscuits & gravy...the works. And at $11, you cannot beat it. They also have amazing mimosas. One'll do you, trust me. 

The lunch & dinner is excellent as well. My favorites are the chicken fried chicken, the bbq, and their ever-famous side of skillet mac & cheese. Also the deserts are on point. Especially that apple cobbler thing. I cannot begin to describe to you how absolutely necessary it is that you order whatever that is. I don't even know how to talk about it without getting emotional. 

Anyway, they have a small variety of local beers and they haven been chosen excellently; you will not feel limited, it's a great selection without being overwhelming. The staff is always so nice and I have never had anything but fantastic service.

The environment is super cute, it's set up like an old grocery store situation, and yes, there is a stage for live music during peak hours.

This is the perfect place to take family & friends who are in from out of town for a local experience. HOWEVER, I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, because honestly, if I'm going to have more than 2 people come in, we will typically not go to this location. We'll go to Puckett's Boathouse on the other side of the square. It has all the same food selections, but it's a MUCH larger restaurant and you're not packed up underneath each other. My one beef with this location is that they've crammed way too many tables in here and you can barely walk through the restaurant to get to the buffet or the restroom. It's just really cramped and the place is usually at least 75% full. 

Aside from the congested-ness of this location, I love coming here and my guests always love it too. Good food variety and fair prices.
