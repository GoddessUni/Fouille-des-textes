Took our youngest Grandson out for lunch - he picked Lucky Wishbone. We visited the location on Harrison near Old Spanish Trail. There were only a couple of people arriving for lunch - seems like quite a few folks order & take it to go. Restaurant was clean, staff was friendly - we ordered a Family Feast of Chicken strips including fries, garlic bread, and substituted onion rings for cole slaw. Food came out pretty quick and was hot & tasty! Love the coating on the chicken - great spices - perfect flavor! Onion rings were cooked perfectly - crispy & full of flavor! Bread was buttery and very garlicy - tasted great! Love their Lucky Wishbone cocktail sauce - goes great with all the food. I guess the only negative is - it's all fried food!
