Last night my friends and I came to Keystone Escape Games for a fun birthday outing. I didn't know what to expect since I had never been to an escape room. Let me tell you! Last night was the most fun I have had in a longgg time. My group was amazing and we finished the room with 12 minutes to spare. Not that is wasn't challenging because it was! You really gotta power through as a team and our tour noggins together. The best part is the adrenaline rush you get when a puzzle gets solved. II highly recommend going here. Most of my friends had already been to an escape room and voted that this was the best one that they have ever experienced. So I will definitely be coming back
