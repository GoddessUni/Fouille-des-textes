Phenomenal! 

I cannot believe we have been living here for 6 years and this is our first time coming here. We went here for lunch around 11:30 and it was not too busy at all, which was perfect.

we had been craving for some fresh seafood so we ended up ordering a lot! The oysters were fresh and the cocktail sauce was awesome! It may be the freshest oysters in STL! 

Peel and eat shrimps were good but not perfect, slightly overcooked!

Gumbo ya ya and lobster poboy were really really good! We love these the most!

Last but not least, fries with sprinkled garlic parmesan are to die for! A must try if you ever come here!
