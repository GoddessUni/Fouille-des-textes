Were this place within 10 miles from my house, we'd eat here once a week I'm sure.

Yes, it's a chain restaurant, but that doesn't really show, and I bet many folks are surprised to learn it's a chain.

The food is really good and you get enough that you shouldn't leave hungry, ever. The wife and I had the meal for two that comes with a dessert and appetizer or salad AND included pastas to take home. The chocolate cake was a hit and plenty big for three people, honestly. The kids' meals were $6 and come with the drink and a dessert, so that's great too.

Five of us (wife and kids 10, 4, 2) got out of there for $88, and that's including the 20% tip. That's not bad for appetizer and desserts. We've spent the same amount other places and left very disappointed.

My only gripes are minor. 4's flatbread pizza took a long time to get to the table because they apparently burnt the first one and had to redo it. The person who delivered our food told us that, and while I did appreciate the runner telling us what happened, and that they went ahead and redid it instead of serving him a burnt pizza, I think it's better service to have a manager come by at some point and simply apologize and explain the delay his or herself. That's my own opinion about how a successful restaurant operates though and, like I said, kudos to them for fixing the pizza without us ever having seen the original one.

Also, we were seated in a corner in the back of the restaurant (no problem here, I get it, we had two small boys with us) and it was near a kiosk where the servers entered orders for the kitchen and hung out when they had some free time. They were eating snacks and having four letter word laden conversations that were inappropriate for the setting. I'm not a prude by any stretch, but if we could hear it, then others could as well.

Still, the food was good and our server was very good as well. My tea was rarely empty for more than a few seconds.
