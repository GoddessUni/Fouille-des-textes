It is always hard to find good brunch places, and if you know me, you know it's hard for me to like a brunch more than one that I Can make for myself.  the best i've had is snooze in fort collins, but this is a very close second! first, I was pleased they serve bfast ALL DAY and that there were SO MANY optoins on the menu! Not only that but you can customize a lot and there were plenty of lunch optoins too, which makes it likely everyone will find something they enjoy.  So I had them custom make my egg dish - 2 poached eggs over asparagus, spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes, with goat cheese, and pumpernickle and rye toast.  It all came out hot and the eggs were done wonderfully!  They also gave me a nice ffuit bowls to sub for the hash browns.  My only complaint is that they dont have eggwhites or skim milk for those customers that are more health conscious.  this would have been nice.  the coffee was pretty good too!
