Came here on my way home from AC, and I was surprised to see that they had quite a wait on a Sunday morning.  Seeing how big the place was, we clearly came to 'the happening spot'.  We got a cozy booth, and a 'with it' waitress which was a total score for a 2-top.  I got 2 eggs, toast and home fries well done.  My boyfriend got an omelet.  I was shocked when our food came out.  It was fast... but not too fast... but it was the first time i ACTUALLY got home fries that were WELL DONE (like i requested).  I was really pleased.  They were delicious.  I can't comment too much on their ability to poach 2 eggs or toast bread, as the cullinary requirements are pretty low, but i can say that i had a bite of my boyfriends omelet and it was STELLAR.  I also have to say that our waitress was at our table every time we needed her as though she just 'knew'.  It was a great, quality, fairly priced, positive experience.  

Oh, and they had cookies at the door- vanilla cookies.  They were awesome too.  A cookie for the road is NEVER a bad thing.
