Love this place! It has everything. Great food, great craft cocktails, beer garden w 40 beers on tap, outdoor seating....great staff. What more do you want? Honestly never made it past the first bar because the bartender, Matt, was too awesome to leave. They will take your liquor of chose and customize a craft cocktail for you. I wasn't that hungry so just had the kale salad and the risotto balls (named something different on small plate menu). Both were great and way more than I could eat! The pizzas looked soooo good but I knew I couldn't order one by myself!
I will be back to visit Matt for great cocktails, beer garden action and a pizza!!
