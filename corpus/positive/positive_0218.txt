This low-calorie, soft serve ice cream shop is conveniently located in the same plaza as Fitlife Foods. At only 50 calories per 4 oz, it's almost a guiltless pleasure. This is not your traditional ice cream or gelato, but I think it's pretty good and it satisfies a craving. It's soft, creamy and not overtly sweet. They don't use sugar alcohols or artificial sweeteners to sweeten their ice cream, so you won't get that uncomfortable bloat that usually accompanies those ingredients. 

Behind the counter they have the soft serve machine with a limited number of flavors that you can get served on cups or cones with a variety of toppings you may add if you so desire (this changes the calorie content, of course). They use vanilla or chocolate as the base to create their other flavors. They do rotate these ready-to-serve flavors pretty much daily or you can always get more flavors to go from their prepackaged section. 

They also sell other nutrition conscious items such as protein bars, PB2 powder, Walden Farms dressings and sauces, low calorie syrups, etc.
