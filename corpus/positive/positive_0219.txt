The food here is always top notch. The spinach feta hummus is my favorite hummus on earth. The salad selection is vegetarian friendly and the sandwiches are delicious. The craft beer selection is great and features a lot of local brews. So with all of the good things out of the way, let me tell you about the service. When you walk in, it's set up deli style and someone takes your order over the counter. The last three times I've come the girl working looks so lost and confused when I talk to her that I'm unsure of what exactly is happening. She tries to cut my order off three different times before I'm finished, can't form complete sentences, and the girl working alongside her just doesn't speak to us at all. I don't care if you're stoned, just make sure you're a functional stoner at least while you're on the clock. The barista was great and gave us an espresso with heavy cream that someone else didn't want. The associate making our salad was bright and friendly. The food is what keeps me coming back, definitely not the weird service.
