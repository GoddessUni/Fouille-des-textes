I picked up some dinner for my family after getting my nails done in the Boulevard. I was able to order ahead and pick up on time very easily. We got the pull apart appetizer bread which was actually the least favorite part of our meal. We both ordered pastas with the extra helping which was definitely a great decision! My ravioli was delicious and heavy like good Italian food should be. My husband loved the lasagna and was happy he got a second portion for work. We hadn't been here before as we usually don't go to a lot of chains but this is worth adding to your dinner rotation.
