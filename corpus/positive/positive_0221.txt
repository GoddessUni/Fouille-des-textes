New Palestine is not known for anything out of the ordinary, until now.  We met a friend for lunch here.....she had been a couple of times before and highly recommended it.

The decor is pretty cool, with the Bonnie and Clyde theme,  Not overdone, not too cute, just right.

But one doesn't go to a restaurant for the decor, bottom line, it's all about the food.

I chose the breaded tenderloin, and, while it's not the best breaded tenderloin I've ever had...I do believe it's the best one in Hancock county.  The breading is spectacular and doesn't get soggy.  The meat appears to be fresh, not frozen.  I chose onion rings as my side, and they were absolutely fantastic!  WELL worth the trip here for them.

Holly had a Tuscan chicken sandwich and absolutely raved about it.  For her side, it was sweet potato fries, and they, also, were amazing.

The service was stellar, and the price was reasonable.  We'll be back.

One caveat....with the restaurant fills up, it tends to get a bit loud.  They could use a little sound baffling here.
