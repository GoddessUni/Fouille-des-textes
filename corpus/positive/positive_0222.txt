Our driver in Nashville insisted that this was the best pizza in town and I cannot say that he was wrong. Came here for lunch on a Thursday and were seated immediately at the table of our choice. The service was great! Our server was nice, attentive, & knowledgeable about the menu. I got the prosciutto-basil slice with arugula salad and a basil lemonade. Everything was delicious! In fact, I have regrets about not ordering a whole pie to-go because I started craving it the moment we left. But the good news is that I no longer have to go to New York to get a real New York style pizza. I can just come to Music City.
