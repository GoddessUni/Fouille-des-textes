I came here when it www high tides years ago. I was here tonight, Friday May 28 for my boss's 40 birthday. I was super abrehensive at first when I realized it was the old High Tides. From the second we walked in, I was so pleasantly surprised!! From the bouncer who greeted us to the bar itself. We had Will and Jenna as our bartenders. They both went ABOVE and beyond to accommodate us. Promptly making our drinks (which were AMAZING btw), Jenna was super sweet and so easy to talk to. Will stopped what he was doing about 1578 times to take pics for us, make our drinks, we ordered appetizers, he recommended what he thought was good. When I asked him if they had a juke box, he then went to the manager, Stacey, who was also FUCKING AMAZING!, and told her "the group of girls at the bar are asking for music, I know they'll love your playlist". Like come on? ANDDDD he told us he just started a couple weeks ago. As a group of hair stylists, we MORE than appreciate outstanding customer service, and that's exactly what we got at Waters Edge! I would absolutely HIGHLY recommend them! Will, Stacey, and Jenna, thank you SO SO very much for making us feel so special, especially fot my boss's birthday. She works hard every single day and owns her own salon. THANK you all a million times over, for making this experience more than amazing! We will ABSOLUTELY be back!
