Eddie's has been a long time go-to for a luxurious meal, so it was apropos that we brought some very close friends that traveled from out of town to dinner there a few weekends ago.  We were not disappointed.  

We sampled some wine and dug into some tasty shrimp appetizers and the filet mignon potstickers.  They are not to be missed.  We took our time and enjoyed the company, wine and food.  Three of us ordered the grilled romaine salad which I can't say enough about.  They introduced this salad last summer and I love that it found a home on their menu permanently.  

The guys ordered the bourbon rib eye and it was simply gorgeous; and it tasted as good as it looked!  I had a perfectly cooked filet mignon and our sides, especially the Eddie's potatoes and the Brussels sprouts were the bomb.  

We spent quite a bit of time talking wine with Eddie and Jason and tried a few things over the course of the evening.  After dinner we ordered several desserts to share and capped off the night with some bourbon tasting and decaf coffee.  It was exactly the experience we had hoped to have and our friends were very impressed.  If you go, be sure to request Jason as your server.  He's knowledgable, friendly, and just a tad sassy.  Have fun!
