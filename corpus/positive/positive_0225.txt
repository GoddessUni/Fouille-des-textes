I'm a fan of Mexican restaurants that share a space with a grocery store. TAQUERIA Aguila is a clean and tidy grocery store with seating for about 15 at the rear of the store. We went on a Friday and there was a food truck outside serving tacos and had a spit of all pastor going. We are inside. I had enchiladas verde - as you can see in the photos it was swimming in sauce. That's not my ideal meal but it was tasty. I ended up eating all the lettuce off the top and took 2/3 to go. My partner enjoyed his al pastor burrito more than I liked the enchiladas. The al pastor was spot on. We bought a few pastries and assorted grocery items on the way out.
