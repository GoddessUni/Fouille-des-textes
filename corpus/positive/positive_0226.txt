Don't follow the Yelp map or you'll end up at the former location which is waaay different.  Big, clean restaurant with good food that is very easy on the wallet.  Carnitas in different sizes lunch (for 1 or 2) or by the pound!  Salsa bar and homemade thick corn tortillas!  They also have cabeza which is outstanding!  The carnitas were real good but not the best I've had.  (The best are marinated in either orange juice, pepsi (not coke) and fried to a golden crispy crunch!)  The carnitas are mass produced and very good, but the cabeza and tortillas and everything else, including the price makes this 5 stars!  It does get very busy at peak times so be warned....go before or after lunch or dinner!  Every time I've gone in there are families and usually some kids who have managed to get probably 1/2 pound of carnitas meat scattered under their high chair!  But, that's a good sign that they enjoyed the meal, right?
