Hot and Sour Soup 5/5:  First off, two of us split a hot and sour soup as an appetizer.  It's $6, but it's big enough for two people.  In fact, I wouldn't recommend that a single person order this unless you plan to make it your meal.  We asked to split it, and they brought us an extra bowl.  It was in my top two best ever hot and sour soups.

Sesame Chicken 5/5:  If you cut it open, you could see the super moist white meat on the inside, tender and cooked perfectly.  On the outside, it was a light fried breading that just the right amount of crisp but not too much and just the right amount of sauce but not too much.  One of the best sesame chickens I've ever had (and that's saying something for me since this what I usually order everywhere).

4 stars overall only because it got a little busy toward end of evening, and our server was stretched thin and it took a while to pay our bill.  No issue with our server - just unfortunate this was the case.  I'd say maybe they should have had more servers on staff, but it was late on a week night, so perhaps this is out of the ordinary.

I could possibly raise this review after the next time I get to try this place.
