Bring cash and your patience.

The food here is delightful. Everything I have tried is among the best Indian food I've had in the states. Service continues to be an issue however. I am rounding up from 3.5 stars since I broke my cardinal rule of not tipping. It is my personal belief that if you can afford to eat out, you can afford to tip. Unfortunately their card system didn't allow me to add a tip to my card and I didn't have cash with me. I would have made a trip to the ATM, but I was already running late for my movie due to the slow service so for the first time in my adult life I left without tipping. I still feel bad about it. 

In any case, if you're in no hurry this place is great. Just bring cash and maybe a book to read.
