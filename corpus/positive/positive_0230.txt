Always have had excellent meals here. I have tried to branch out but plum pork medallions on dinner menu (I always ask for fries and asparagus instead of sides they pair with and feel confident it is superior) have always been what I wished I had ordered whenever I've strayed. I think escargot is best appetizer I've tried (though don't remember what else they offer aside from melty brie plate, which was alright) FIVE STARS FOR BRUNCH, cinnamon & sugar beignets are AWESOME and addictive, I have always asked for hybrid of Benedicts they serve: beef tenderloin w/cayenne hollandaise sauce SOOO GOOD but ask for extra side as sauce can be a little scanty, also if you arrive towards late end of brunchtime they sometimes run out.
