This place is where you should be everyday of the week, especially for Sunday brunch. Parking was bit of a problem but nothing unbearable. I love how this place is set up, very cozy with specs of green throughout the restaurant. I could smell the sweetness of basil while we were seated outside. Our waiter was super cool and checked on us quite often throughout our food journey. Plus, we had the pleasure of meeting Troy, restaurant manager. He came by to check on us, great surprise.  

We started the brunch with the oh-so-refreshing Ginger Pomberry. Who knew the mixture of pomegranate, strawberry and ginger goes so well, bravo to whomever made this drink into reality. Next came the salads, we opted for Organic spinach and Caprese, both were amazing. The goat cheese croquette, WOW, loved it!! The only criticism I had was the spinach salad was overly dressed. The dressing was fantastic but overpowered the subtle flavors of spinach and almonds. 

For entrees, we had Boca bacon and 7 spiced ahi Tuna. Boca bacon aka BLT was amazing, best part was the fried egg amidst all the bacon goodness. I could eat that everyday. The ahi tuna dish wasn't what I was expecting but great nonetheless. It was surprisingly light, loved the lightly seared tuna and grilled bok choy. I just wished it was little spicier. 

Since no meal is finished without dessert, we ordered the chocolate tart with macerated berries. I really didn't care for it, the tart shell was too hard to cut into. Overall, fantastic meal. I'll def be back.
