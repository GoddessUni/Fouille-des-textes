My husband and I effing love this place. We used to be in much more regularly but it's gotten so busy (for good reason)! I recommend it to everyone, though I now regret it and wish it was my own special breakfast secret.The service has always been amazing and the menu is bonkers delicious. Hubs almost always gets the Coyote Benedict, which I also got the first 3 or 4 times we went. It. is. so. good!! I've since branched out and tried the chilaquiles, breakfast tacos, pancakes, chorizo enchiladas, and omelettes, and I can honestly say everything I've had has been great! Hubs was brave and got the patty melt last time - it was the best one I've ever tasted. Awesome coffee and bloody marys too. We love you, Baja Cafe. Never change.
