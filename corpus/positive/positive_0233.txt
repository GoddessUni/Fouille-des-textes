Went to Shooters for dinner last night. Never had been before. If you are going for the first time here is a piece of advice....get the deep fried ribs and order as many of them as you can eat!!! They were AMAZING! They slow cook their ribs like most places do, but the deep fried ribs they coat in some sort of brown sugar rub and drop them in the deep fryer. What is on your plate is nothing short of heaven on a rib bone. The best ribs I've ever had. Unbelievable. We also had an order of Wings for an appetizer. They were very good juicy chicken wings and the sauce was hot, but not crazy hot... exactly what I'm looking for in a hot wing. 

The only thing keeping me from giving this place 5 stars was that the service was a little slow considering the restaurant wasn't very full. I will say though, the food was well worth the wait. The other thing was that I was a bit disappointed with was the sides I had ordered with my ribs. The sweet n sour cole slaw was not too bad, but I didn't feel like it had much flavor. And the potato salad was, for lack of a better term, "fluffy. It was like a really fluffy mayo based potato salad, but my serving was almost all "fluff" and no actual potatoes, and again was very bland tasting.  But the friend I ate with ordered fries and onion rings, which i also tried, and they were both delicious. 

Overall though, this place was great. Fun atmosphere and AMAZING deep fried ribs. Will definitely be frequenting this place!
