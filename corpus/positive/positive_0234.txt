Hard to believe that Wine Exchange has been around
For so many years yet we often overlook going there for dinner or to gran a drink. Now that we are dipping our feet in post Covid we decided to do our Father's Day celebration at the Wine Exchange. Our party of 9 was seated promptly and our waitress was wonderful.  We each got a frozen pi√±a colada which was super yummy. For appetizers we tried the deviled eggs and the risotto and shrimp. The deviled eggs were tasty and creamy the risotto was good but a little bit too salty. For my entree I got the chicken pecan salad over mixed greens. We also got the pasta carbonara which is the entree I've been getting here for years and years and it is still very good and cheesy. The salad was just ok but I did like the fact that everything I mean everything was sprinkled with edible flowers. Very pretty. We will be back soon and I will have to throw carbs out the window and get the carbonara. It's the best!
