This past weekend, after the Iron girl half marathon and 5k, we went to the Wildflower cafe.  We wrote our name on the lsit outside the resturant and they seated us withing 7 minutes.  It was a beautiful day out so we were lucky to sit outsdie.  We ordered the eggs and bacon, I asked for my bacon on another plate (unfortuantly, I think she thought I was joking and that was on top of my eggs ) 
Everything else was pretty delicios.  The eggs were made nicely as well as the potatoes.  The buttermilk biscuits came with what looked like homemade jam.  I would go back again and order some other fun stuff to try.  They had their brunch menu out.  ALso, inside they had a nice little bakery that I was so tempted to order from, luckily I forgot since we were sitting outside
