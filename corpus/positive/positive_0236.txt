This place did not disappoint! MUST-GO place if you're in New Orleans. 
Service: excellent, very attentive and detailed. 
Food: everything was just superb! 
*There was a complementary bite-size hors d'oeuvre*
Appetizers - the beer-battered crab beignets were to die for! The prosciutto was also very tasty. 
Meat - the braised boneless short ribs were amazing. Great flavor, tender and very filling, despite the size. 
Sides- gruyere potato au Gratin was the perfect side for the meat. Soft and crunchy. 
Dessert: creole cream cheese bread pudding. It wasn't was I was expecting, but a very sweet surprise. 

You can't go wrong with this place. Dress code is between casual and dressy (if you can dress up, even better).
