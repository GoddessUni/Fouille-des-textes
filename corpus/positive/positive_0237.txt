I love breakfast.  I will eat it any chance I get.  I particularly love to get breakfast at the cities I travel to around the country.  You can judge a city by the good breakfast places they have.  And Boise has one of the best breakfast places anywhere with Goldy's.

The wait can be short.  Or it can be up to a half hour or so.  It is not that large with two levels.  It is downtown and a block from one of the biggest hotels in Boise, The Grove.  It is full of businesspeople, students, out of towners and anyone else who wants good grub.

The eggs are delightful.  
the sausage patties were pattied by hand from bulk sausage and not some pre-packaaged, pre-cooked stuff.  The potatoes were fresh (they should be!) and the coffee was not bad.

What makes this place special is the magical way it is all put together.  The taste, preperation, quality and attention they pay to you. My two business associates swear by the place and so do I.

Want a good breakfast.  Go to Goldy's.
