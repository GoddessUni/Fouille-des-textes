For special occasions, they use a tent to expand seating while not interfering with normal service.  Older people love it because the prices are reasonable.  And younger people love it because its waterside and has a nice vibe.  The food is consistently good, and the service is usually attentive and fast.  Even the valet parking is quick and friendly.
