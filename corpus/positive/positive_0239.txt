BEST CHILAQUILES IN TOWN 

Quetzally is a quaint and small kind of hole in the wall sort of establishment. They bop sick golden Mexican day ballads from the likes of Jose Jose to Juan Gabriel. They usually play all the soccer games I ever want to watch and when they're not playing soccer, they're playing the novela of the hour. The service is straightforward and not overbearing. They refill my water when it's gone, take my orders at good timing, provide free chips and salsa, and are easy to flag down since it's such a small place. 

Chilaquiles are my favorite almuerzo/brunch food and Quetzally delivers. A+++++ across the freaking board on portion size, aesthetics, and yumminess. They are a freaking massive delight of carbs and protein and flavor. The chilaquiles aren't the only bomb thing here. My friend who's obsessed with protein got his fill with the fajita platter which came in sizzling and proliferously invading and filling our nostrils. 

It's not the most beautiful place you're ever going to dine in but the food is great and mighty. 

FYI - for some reason the chilaquiles aren't on the menu but order them and they'll make them as if they were.
