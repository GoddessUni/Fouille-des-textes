I've frequented this location of the Continental about five times in the last year and every experience from food to service has been wonderful. 

Most recently, my husband and I did outdoor dining. Although the location at the intersection of some busy streets is not ideal, you do what you need to do during these times.  

We ordered a hamburger and a turkey burger. Both came with the option of a side salad or french fries. We were surprised on how large and delicious the side salad was and French fries were great too. We both enjoyed our burgers. 

We've been here for brunch a few times and had great food and service during that occasion. I've had the Crunchy Brioche French Toast and omelette.  Additionally, we've also been here for New Year's Eve last year.  We appreciated the fact they were serving their regular menu and not a pricey NYE 3 or 4 course prix fixe.

We had a wonderful evening. The food was awesome, service was great and I really love the ambiance here.  It was a very busy night given the occasion, but the entire staff and our waitress were on the ball.  The staff was all dressed in sparkly party attire, which was a nice touch for the night.

I ordered the Baby Kale and Beet Salad and the Spinach Ravioli.  The salad was great, but I especially loved the Ravioli.  I'm not one for thick heavy pasta dishes, but this Ravioli was prepared very thin. In fact you could see the spinach right through it.  It was really tasty! 

The rest of the table ordered the Seared Tuna, Salmon Sashimi Pok√© Bowl, Braised Short Rib.  Everyone enjoyed their meal. 

Dessert was the only thing that did not impress me too much. We ordered the Smores Cheesecake, and the Cookie and Brownie Sundae.  The desserts were good, but nothing to write home about.
