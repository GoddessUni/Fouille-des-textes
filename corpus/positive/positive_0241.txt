How do you make a choice of just one here? There are so many delicious smoothies to choose from, almost all of them priced under $5. It is protein heaven! I will be returning for sure. The smoothie I had today was the "Max Daddy" at $5.50 and is the King Kong of protein drinks here. Soymilk, bananas, raspberries, cherries, granola, honey, yogurt, and TRIPLE protein! It was so delicious. I had brain freeze after brain freeze gulping this down.

My friend had the Black and Blue which has soymilk, blueberries, granola, yogurt, double protein and usually has blackberries. But they substituted cherry instead since they were out of blackberries. It was delicious and polished off very fast as well. They do a good smoothie here. 

Delicious, healthy, and a good price with an awesome selection. I wish they had wheatgrass. Great place!
