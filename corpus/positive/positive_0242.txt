Last night was our first of many times dining at Seasons 52.  I previously considered it practically impossible for any chain restaurant to be worthy of 5 stars, but I now stand corrected.  Literally everything about our experience at Seasons 52 was perfect.

Our server, Madeline, was very friendly and attentive, even though the place was packed and she must have been very busy.  By the way, now I understand why this restaurant was packed on a Monday night.

The decor and atmosphere are very nice and the piano player behind the bar is an interesting idea.  In fact, as unimportant as that is to the dining experience, it's one of many examples that a lot of thought seems to have gone into making Seasons 52 unique.  That uniqueness carries through to the food in that the calorie-consciousness and seasonality of the menu in no way detract from the quality.

We shared the Ripe Plum Tomato flatbread and a Mussels appetizer that I don't recall the specific name of -- both were very good.  In fact, I would recommend that everyone try one of the flatbreads since they're unique to Seasons 52 and very good.

For entrees, I had the Caramelized Grilled Sea Scallops and my wife had the Grilled Jumbo Shrimp with Penne Pasta.  Both were excellent in terms of both tastes and presentation, which is also the case with the desserts.

The small-serving desserts are an excellent idea and they somehow manage to pack just as much flavor into those little glasses as any full-size dessert.  The Key Lime Pie was actually one of the best I've had, including the many times I've had it at many different places in the Keys ... not so tart that it makes you wish you had gotten a real dessert, yet not so sweet that there's no hint of the lime taste ... perfect.
