Came here Saturday evening with a group of 15 for a birthday dinner.  We were seated upstairs in a private room which was great!  You could still hear other conversations around us, but it was nice to have the privacy.

Service 100% was a 5!  We had two servers both were super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  

Food would be more about a 4.5/5.  Very very good, but nothing out of the ordinary.  We split a bunch of apps - mussels, fried cheese, antipasti. All were so good! I had the tilapia special which was good.  My boyfriend got the gnocchi which was awesome but I was not a fan of the meatballs.  A little too dense and not very flavorful. 

I still am ranking this a 5 overall because the ambiance and service were amazing. Definitely will be back!
