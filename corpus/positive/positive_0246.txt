Another good brewery. It's also a distillery. 10 Torr is east of Midtown. Has a nice bar inside. You can also sit outside on a patio. 

I like most of the beers. Last time I had the Hazewagon. This is about $6 for a pint. It's a hazy IPA. This is made with mosaic hops, which have a tropical smell. Oats is what gives this a hazy body. This is one of the higher alcohol beers they have on tap. Also they have some heavier beers. They have a malty porter. It's good if you like this kind. There's also cocktails if you need harder stuff. 

Fun even just hanging around. It's recommended to get a beer of course. They don't have any food so eat before going there.
