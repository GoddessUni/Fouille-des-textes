Started with the Sweet Potato Beignets (would not have ordered because I didn't think I was a fan of Duck, but Laura at the bar talked me into it) I'm glad she did, because they were phenomenal. Also had the Shrimp & Tasso Pinchos....  again wonderful and the presentation was really cool. (don't judge me for having 2 appetizers... I was there a long time :-)

Main course was the Geaux Fish with pureed cauliflower. All cooked perfectly.

Forgot to mention the drinks... the Boulevardier was really good, but then i switched to my old standby (the Old Fashioned) and was extremely happy with what Laura whipped up!

There's a lot of restaurants in New Orleans but do yourself a favor and don't miss this one next time you're here!!! Hats off to Chef Juan Carlos Gonzalez and the entire staff!
