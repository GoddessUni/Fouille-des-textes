It was quite a great experience! We went to Olympia on a warm winter afternoon, and we asked to do outdoor dining as they have a great and beautiful patio!

We ordered a gyro on pita and a platter with lamb. They both tasted very good. The gyro was thin-sliced and flavorful, and even better with the cream. The pita bread was soft and you can smell the flour (so good!). The lamb was a bit meaty and oily but it goes great with the veggies and pita bread, so make sure you eat them together. The rice was the best and the most surprising part for me! So good!! Service is also good. 

I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
