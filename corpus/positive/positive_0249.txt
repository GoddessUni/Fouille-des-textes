My favorite Breakfast place when I come to Tucson. This is our 2nd. time here. Clutch that you can make a reservation unlike many of the popular brunch places in Tucson you have to wait and wait and wait. The food here is still as good as when I came a year ago. The service is always good, super friendly. 

There were 3 of us in our party. We ordered Drunken Tomatoes, the Folded Egg (Jalapeno, Scallion, Bacon and Cheese with Smashed Hash) and The Honey Chipotle Carnitas Benedict (crumpet, crispy pork, wilted spinach, eggs, hollandaise) and The Cinnamon Roll Griddlecakes. All the food came out hot, fresh and tasting incredible!

Atmosphere: open upbeat, great outdoor patio. Service: excellent. Food: excellent.
