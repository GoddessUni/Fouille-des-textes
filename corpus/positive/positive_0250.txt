This place is pretty nice. They have decent beer , service and food. But only a few things that stand out. 

The problem is some of the menu items are very blah. And they don't have a large selection. 

For example the pretzels bites are ok but not worth 11 bucks. You can get a better pretzel almost anywhere for much cheaper. I think quick trips is better to be honest.

The BBQ nachos were my favorite but definitely could be executed better. Pork belly is better crispy drop it in the deep fried then smother with sauce and boom much better.
