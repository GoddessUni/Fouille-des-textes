I like this little restaurant, especially the lovely outdoor patio. The lights make for a really relaxing environment perfect for great conversation. 

I started off with my favorite, the Sazerac. The pour was quite generous and always the perfect way to start an evening. 

Small, hard biscuits with butter were handed out as though they may break the bank if a small basket of them were placed on the table. I was a little peeved at first but after working so hard to break the little nugget open I decided 1 was enough. Yes, it's not your regular crusty style French bread, it's just rather crusty. 

Moving on. I ordered the prix fixe menu and started with the chilled tomato soup. It was tasty, not sure why they didn't call it gazspacho but whatever. 

Then came my braised beef with mashed potatoes and bacon lardons. This was a solid dish, I wish it had more of an alcohol flavor to it. It was filling though and I would eat it again. 

I finished the meal with the floating island dessert. I wasn't sure what it was but I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't overly sweet and finished the meal on a light note. 

Overall I enjoyed the ambience of the place and would definitely go back for another taste of the menu.
