I have been a fan of the 12 South location for several years. Now that I live in Nolensville I am THRILLED to have Maf's much closer.  The new location is gorgeous.  So spacious and good ambiance.  Can not wait to try out the patio now that it is open.   Happy is great with plenty of Beer and wine options not to mention so tasty Craft Cocktails to choose from.  We went for a friend's birthday.  The staff was very helpful with the Cake I brought in.  Our apps were quite tasty.  And I really appreciated out Waiter's input when several of us asked about different menu items. Great for a group dinner, excellent for Happy Hour but also could serve as a wonderful Date Night Venue.  Check it out Franklin this is a WONDERFUL addition to the Factory Options.
