I planned on bringing donuts into work. Not a whole lot of options around me. I was concerned about this  place because of all the bad reviews. The good reviews seemed "planted". Had no choice though.

Went in with my elderly father around 7:30 AM and it was a really good experience. A customer held the door open for my Dad. The clerk was nice. She asked my father "And what would *you* like, young man?"

This business about there being hardly a bite of creme/jelly/whateva in their donuts. Hogwash. Plenty.

The customer in front of us was kind of high-maintenance so we hung out and ate our donuts while my "work" order was being filled. They even brought it to our table.

Very kind and hardworking folk. I'd say give 'em a chance.
