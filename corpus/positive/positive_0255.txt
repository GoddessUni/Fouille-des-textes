We went to three different places to try beignets while in NOLA.  We were on a mission to find the best place. 

I was a bit skeptical when my friend told me that her friend had recommended Morning Call to us and said that it was better than Cafe Du Monde.  So as we set out on our beignet journey, we tried Cafe Du Monde first.  

We actually went back twice just to see if there was a difference and each time we were disappointed.  We were even more disappointed after trying Cafe Beignet.  

On our last day in NOLA, we decided to try this place out not having high hopes at all but we were proven wrong.  They had the BEST beignets ever.  The inside of this place had a very old feel to it.  I think it was purposely decorated like you stepped back into the 1920's.  It was packed but not crowded where there was a line out the door.  We were seated quickly and ordered our coffees and beignets.  We could see the guy making the beignets behind the counter and he only made them when they were ordered so we got piping hot fresh beignets that were chewy and crispy all in one.  We ended up ordering three plates to split between four people because we loved them so much and had to have it before we left.  I had only wished we went here first as we would've come every single day during our stay.  I miss you Morning Call and wish you were in LA!
