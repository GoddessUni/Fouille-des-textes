I have been to Oyster House several times!! The fish, oysters, clams, shrimp etc are as fresh as can be! You can watch your shucker shuck each and every oyster at the bar! The best thing about the Oyster house is their happy hour 1 dollar shucks a 3 dollar drafts and a 5 dollar punch cocktail! They do this till5-7 monday to friday and  starting at 9 on Saturdays! I love the punch cocktails it is so cute as they are served in maison jars. Recently went here for Restaurant Week and the Lobster Roll was the best roll I have ever had!! toasted buttery long roll with chilled lobster delicious, I appreciated how they did not overdress the lobster. The Calamari was seasoned very well, as well.  Even if you cannot get a reservation at your preferred time try to walk in- they hold a certain amount of tables for walkin s only! I've gotten lucky a few time before this way!!
