First off, just a good looking place all around.  As soon as I walked in, I noticed the seating and immediately questioned if it would be hard or soft.  For a second I thought it was wood but it turned out to be all cushion.  Sushi was good.  I am biased and spoiled on sushi, from a place by me in GA.  Yes in GA.  As all other sushi places go that i have been to i would say this is definitely one of the top.  I had some easy stuff.  philly, cali and shrimp temp rolls.  I avoid getting crazy on sushi unless I have visited the place before.  Lets just say I walked out full, smiling, and a higher level of mercury then when I entered
