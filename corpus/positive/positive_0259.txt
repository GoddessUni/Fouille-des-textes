Run by the same owners that own Simply Thai just further North on Lindbergh, this place is just the same, except with far superior lunch specials.  It's pretty obvious that they were shooting for the working lunch hour when they moved here with lunch combos including a crab rangoon, a spring roll, and a soup of the day.  The soup can range from Tom Yum Goong to Hot and Sour Soup.  Going there with the vegetarian coworker rocks cuz it means a double helping of soup :-D

With that said, the food is exactly like Simply Thai with some solid Pad Thai.  Their curries are only so so and I haven't had anything from their Chinese Takeout menu.  Another solid choice would be that pad see euw.
