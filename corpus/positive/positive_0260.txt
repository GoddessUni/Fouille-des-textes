By far the greatest overall meal we had in NOLA. An absolute institution, and there's clearly a reason why. Old school service that is top notch - you really feel like royalty. Staff is friendly and attentive. We went for their lunch special that goes from 11:30-1:30 - we arrived at 11:30 thinking there would be a big wait but we went right in - it definitely filled up later though.
We had the beef, turtle soup (AMAAAAZING!!), shrimp and grits and the souffl√© for dessert that was so soft and fluffy and decadent. And the 25 cent martinis that they offer make the deal even sweeter! (There's a limit of 3, but that's really all you need!) 
I'm sure the dinner is just as spectacular, but lunch is really a great way to experience the restaurant without the dinner rush. It's also so nice to take the streetcar out and wander around the garden district and make an afternoon of it! 
Make sure you make Commanders Palace one of your stops when visiting!
