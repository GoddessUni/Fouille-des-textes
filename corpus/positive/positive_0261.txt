Biscuits are very good. The sausage was yummy. It's worth the hype to try. 

GO EARLY! Plan on waiting. We got there at 8:30 on a Friday morning.  The line was just past the store & we were told it would be 10-15 min. It was really 20 min to get inside,  then you wait in a short line to order at counter, then you wait to be seated. By 9 am the line had doubled outside. By 10 the line tripled. 

Seating: It's really not that large. Some community tables but large parties can be split up. Offer to split up & sit at the bar to get ahead of those who have to sit together. 

Service: Friendly. Door attendant was helpful. 
Price: Is very reasonable for large portions.
