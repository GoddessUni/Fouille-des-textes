We absolutely loved this place. It's in the heart of the French Quarter, which means it's probably frequented more by tourists than anything else, but we felt this was one of the least touristy places we visited in the area! Counter seating only, you server calls out your order to the "chef" just a few feet away,great diner menu, what else can you ask for?

I had the cheeseburger and an order of fries. An order is easily enough for two people. Jon got the Chef's Special omelette, which has turkey, ham, bacon, cheese, and covered in chili. Awesome. For the money you'll spend on vacation in this city, The Grill's price point is easier on the wallet than most spots and just as filling.
