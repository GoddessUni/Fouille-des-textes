Ok, what a surprise this place was. We were staying down the street and wanted to eat somewhere with a tv so that we could watch playoff baseball and found this place on Yelp. Reviews were so/so, but it was walking distance and we were exhausted from traveling and just wanted some grub. Almost walked right by it, as you would not think there was a sports bar there. We walked in, there is a sign saying seat yourself, so we did. I know everywhere is short staffed right now with peeps not wanted to go back to work yet, so it took a few minutes to get menus, but our server was friendly enough when she got to us. Dirty, wrinkled paper menus had me a little concerned (I was in the restaurant biz for almost 25 years, so I might have some peeves ) but man oh man... the food was the bomb. So good! I had the Baja burger, my daughter the pesto pasta with chicken and my husband had the bourbon pepper steak salad. Throughout the meal, all three of us kept saying how tasty everything was. I live 5 hours away, but my daughter lives in the Reno area; She said she is definitely going to be back and I know the next time I am up for a visit, I want to go back too to try everything else they have to offer. Great job!
