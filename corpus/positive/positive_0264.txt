While they don't have a gluten free menu, the staff was very knowledgeable about the ingredients in their dishes.  I thoroughly enjoyed my salad and shrimp and grits!  Try the Strawberry Shrub for something different to drink!  Like most restaurants in the French Quarter, this was a pricey place to eat, but IMO, you pay nearly the same to eat at other spots where the food isn't nearly as good.

Reservations recommended - when we tried to do a walk-in for dinner, they were fully booked and didn't take any walk-ins.  For lunch the following day, we were able to walk-in (in fact, they didn't take reservations for lunch), but we were told there would be an hour wait.  It was more like 15 minutes.
