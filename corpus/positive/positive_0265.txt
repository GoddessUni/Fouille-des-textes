The standard tap is more than a bar to me. The Standard Tap is like an old friend. Consistent and loyal, always welcoming, no matter how long I stay away. The food is great, and their are plenty of options. they have a nice beer list, and I always find something I want. The music never disappoints, and I can almost hear it whisper" I know you love this song, Steve" They are known for their burger, but in the countless times I have been there, I have never had one. Too many other choices. some of my favorites are bratwurst and sauerkraut, chicken pot pie, Muscles and chorizo and the lamb sandwich. 
Like an old friend, I probably take the Tap for granted. I might forget to mention it when discussing "must try spots" I know it doesn't need me to sing it's praises, but its always nice to hear, so... I love you buddy, thanks for being you.
