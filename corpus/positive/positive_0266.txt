Simple Delicious Deli Sandwich. Get any 'special'(the corned beef special is my pick). Russian Dressing, Cole Slaw, and deli meat that is fresh with every bite and is so thinly sliced that you'd swear a samurai did it. Seriously...those amish must have a stash of katanas hidden around somewhere....

Served on soft Rye bread, and with just enough dressing and cole slaw to add a creaminess and tang but not overpower the meat itself(one of the cardinal sins of sandwich making). You can eat at the counter, or take a to-go order. In any case you'll have your sandwich in all of 30-45 seconds and devour it equally fast. At about $7.50 each, they actually stack quite a bit of meat so you are getting a great sandwich for a good value.
