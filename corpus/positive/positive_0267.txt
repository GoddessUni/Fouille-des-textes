I actually had a long enough lunch break today to go out for lunch.  Yay!  This is actually only about a 5 minute walk from my office, and they were super-efficient, so I need to remember this would be do-able even with a shorter break than I had today.     The food was delicious!  I love falafel, and the falafel pita was great.   The falafel was crispy on the outside and tender, moist and nicely seasoned inside.   There are a ton of choices here, but they make it easy.   For the pita sandwiches, you have a choice of hummus or baba ghanoush.   I went with the baba ghanoush and it was excellent.    You then pick your protein, a sauce, I went with tahini, and toppings which included a great variety of vegetables.     Everything was fresh and flavorful.  Even the pita was fresh, and it held up nicely to all the filling.   I didn't even need to resort to using a fork as often happens if pitas start falling apart; this one did not.   I got a side of fries as well they were hot out of the fryer and wonderful.  I definitely was to come back and try some of the bowl options too.    Service was fast and friendly.  This is an excellent choice among the 10th and Indiana establishments!
