The Gardenville Hotel has been standing guard on Durham Road for more than two and a half centuries, protecting travelers between Newtown and Easton from night terrors before, during and after the Revolution. In those days not every battle was in an open field, or behind trees or stone walls, but in the hearts of patriots and loyalists. It was in this very tavern that the debates about liberty and fidelity to the crown were argued, people took sides and made decisions that would effect their lives and the course of history. If you belly up to the bar today you may hear similar talk about status quo and change voiced with the same ferocity. It is good that some things never change much. The issues are as important today in their own way.

If you don't come for the history, be sure to come for the grub. It is very good. The kitchen knows what to do with meat. They have a smoker out back and a grill in house that does a job on brisket, prime rib, babybacks and steak that will satisfy the savage carnivore within. Our prime rib and brisket sandwiches were a load and a half of perfectly smoked and slathered beef, pretending to fit on a Kaiser roll. Each was enough for two meals. My side of baked beans came in a nice size dish that was about the best I'd ever tasted. Zangin' and twangin'! 

You wouldn't think of Gardenville as a custom beer joint or martini bar, but they have enough choice to keep you satisfied. Between an IPA and citrus shandy, we were happy campers. The bar food is mostly fried, but there are plenty of quality options deeper in the menu and specials. Service is a pleasure with black and whites who enjoy their jobs. 

Whether you live nearby or have to drive for a while, Gardenville Hotel is a worthwhile trip back in time.
