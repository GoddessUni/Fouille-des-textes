We had a great experience at Sullivan's for our anniversary dinner. The service was excellent and they took the extra time to make sure everything was perfect. Very good value when it comes to classier/ upscale steak houses. I would recommend Sullivan's for anyone looking for a place to go for business, special occasion or even just a night out. The bar area looked nice as well with a more laid back atmosphere which we will try next time. They added a nice touch by taking our picture and giving it to us before we left with the date and a happy anniversary memo.
