Lunch here was quite honestly a singularly perfect meal. I'm actually shocked that it wasn't busy at all - I think we were maybe one of two tables of diners! From the moment we sat down to our walking out the door, I can't imagine asking for a better experience.

First off, our server was impeccable. Ask for Don, because he's smiley, friendly, knows the menu thoroughly, and is exceptionally efficient. Sure, the fact that we were the only folks in the house probably didn't hurt, but he really showed off his skillz.

The grub's also a-okay. I'm partial to Texas style 'cue over the vinegary stuff they serve up in Carolina, but put a gigantic (and I mean... -gigantic-) mound of meat in front of me, and I'll be happy as a pig in mud. Beyond the ribs (which are ample, even in a half portion), the sides truly shine. Do -not- miss out on the amazing mac 'n' cheese. And they serve German potato salad, which mysteriously just goes well with 'cue. I think it's the temperature thing.

I'm also an utter geek, and love the gadgetry they whipped out to clamp down a roll of paper towels (crucial when making a mess with your meal) to the side of our table. That they serve drinks in mason jars only makes me adore this joint that much more.

Just thinking about this meal (and the leftovers I had for dinner) makes me feel full. And that's always a happy, happy feeling.
