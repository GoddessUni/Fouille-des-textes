First off, I'm so excited about this location.  It's a great place to get late night food on the east side without smelling like a cigarette pack when you leave.  

We stopped in yesterday to grab a couple of slices and an app.  The pizza was decent but when you order by the slice, it's obvious they just heat it up in the oven before bringing it to your table... like a Sbarro. Which isn't a bad thing but I was expecting a tad more fresh.  It was good though (I had a slice of artichoke heart and feta) and next time we'll be ordering a whole pie.  They look delicious!

Beer menu isn't too shabby either :)
