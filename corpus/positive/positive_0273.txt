The food and service at Bogarts are amazing!! I am new to a gluten free diet and they provide a separate menu that lists all of the items that are gluten free. I really appreciate the separate menu because it makes it much easier and faster to figure out what I can eat. I had the Pick 2 Plate with pulled pork, beef brisket, pit baked beans, and applesauce. My husband had the rib combo with pulled pork, pit baked beans, and potato salad. We were both completely satisfied with our meals and we had more than enough food!! We will definitely be back again!!!
