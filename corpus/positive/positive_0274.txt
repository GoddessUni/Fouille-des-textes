The outdoor patio is what drew me to this new restaurant.  The day I stopped by it was raining so we decided to get a table inside.  Beautiful bar and nice atmosphere with Mexican decor.  We were greeted by the owner and seated.  Complimentary chips and salsa were delicious and fresh.  The top shelf margarita was served in a silver mug and garnished with lime and strawberry, amazing!  Next we tried the ceviche, it was excellent.  I had the appetizer sampler platter and my friend had the mixed grill.  The food was amazing.  We're very excited about this restaurant and highly recommend.  They have 2 for 1 Margaritas all day Monday-Thursday.  I can't wait to go back with a group and sit out on their patio.  Thanks Jose for the great service and food!
