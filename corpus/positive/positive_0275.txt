As I pulled up to the restaurant I was quite nervous as there seemed to be no one inside. I went inside and there was only one other table on a Friday at 8pm.

Needless to say, I was worried the selection of meats on for just two tables would be lacking but boy was I wrong. All the cuts we had were delicious and the most notable was the garlic steak. As other reviews have stated, the pineapple is a must have and really helps to keep your palette fresh with all the savoury food options. 

The salad bar wasn't bad as well, but I must say I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of meats and even more pleased thay this is about ~$10 less than Pampa's.
