Cute seating area on other side of restaurant featuring a comfy couch, tables, chairs and books to read.

Gladly bagged order separately as I was delivering 2 orders to the crew in various places this morning. 

Previously working in the food industry,  we would ask customers not to point over,  peer over and talk over the sneeze guard because it is not sanitary and quite frankly rude...Sign respectfully asking customers to stand back from sneeze guard...love it!

The biscuits are huge so I could not eat it in one sitting.  Next day warm up was almost as good but the first day was definitely the best so you may want to split your order with a friend.  Lots of bacon on the maple bacon that will not disappoint bacon lovers.   My SO said the chicken pot pie biscuit was so good it was all gone in one sitting.

Definitely will visit again!
