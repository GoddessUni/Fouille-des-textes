When I first heard about The Little Tuna I heard nothing but good things, so when I decided to try it out and read some reviews I was surprised to see so many negative comments.

Well anyway, I went and I am glad I did because I found it was pretty good. Knowing that the menu is a little pricey for me I was excited that they had a special 4 course menu for $20. Perfect for trying it out for the first time, as I don't like to spend a lot of cash if it's going to suck. I ordered lobster bisque, three-bean sald, blackened tuna and bananas foster bread pudding. The soup was damn tasty, the salad so-so, the tuna delicious and cooked perfectly, and the pudding absolutely divine.

The place is pretty small so it was perfect for an intimate dinner for two, but I would never dare to bring a large group of my rowdy friends. All in all, I would recommend The Little Tuna and plan to eat there again.
