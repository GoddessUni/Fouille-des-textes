Revolution ice cream company is anything but vanilla (sorry, had to)!  I think I will contribute my weight gain to living near this place for 6 months.  

It's in a strip mall so you could pass it up very easily. Inside there is art all over the walls from local artists and a mish mash of  furniture.  It's not the stark and sterile looking ice cream place so grab a spoon and get down with one or six flavors. They serve by the scoop and also in a half dozen styrofoam egg carton so you can try 6 different flavors. They have seasonal flavors to choose from and rotate the others regularly. Some of my favorites have been the brownie batter, rumchata, mint want cookies (mint chocolate chip and cookie dough), blueberry cobbler, peanut butter cheesecake, etc. They even use Girl Scout cookies when they are in season!  Hello Samoas!!!

This place is heaven on earth!
