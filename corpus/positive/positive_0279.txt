The vibe to this place is great and so was the brunch, definitely recommend making reservations, we did through Resy. 

We sat in the lounge and the ambiance with upholstered chairs and sofas was that of anthropology meets a whisky lounge. They had hand sanitizer on all the tables and the staff were all wearing mask 

The French toast were incredibly decadent and more like a bread pudding. The potatoes were so perfectly crispy and accompanied with a nacho cheese sauce, avocados, pico de Gallo , chives and the unfortunate part a hard poached egg. Even though the egg didn't have the runny consistency of your traditional poached egg, the meal did not disappoint. Honestly cannot wait to go back! The service was great too
