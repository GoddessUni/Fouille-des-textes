This was my first visit to this location. Came for brunch on a Sunday. Food is great but I've got to be honest, the jam packed crowd is a turn off. 

Highlights:
-Great menu options, creative crepes, and you can turn them into an omelet for the egg lover (like myself)
-Fun takes on standard brunch cocktails
-A TON of seating
-Bright and open

Downsides:
-Long wait
-Community tables: my friend and I were relieved not to be seated at one. I'm sure it's to decrease wait time, but honestly these tables are miserable to be seated at, so hard to have a conversation!
-Loud
-Expensive drink prices (food is really reasonable though!)
