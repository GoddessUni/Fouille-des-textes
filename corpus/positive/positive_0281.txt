knocked 1 star because I'm not the biggest fan of excessive SODIUM intake. but besides that I loved the food. Southern hospitality / comfort fo sho.

Fried catfish is delicious! definitely made my meal. I also got mac n cheese which to me had too much salt and too much pepper, and the green beans which was WAY salty. The lemonade is AMAZING definitely get! 

Cafeteria style ordering, you go up in a line and get your food. then pay and then find your own seating. Pro Tip: clean up your own mess afterwards and put your tray up like you're supposed to. I saw a few ppl leave their mess behind which led to disgruntled employees.
