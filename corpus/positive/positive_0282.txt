Great experience overall! They offered great discounts and free delivery. The food was tasty, the order came in a timely manner, and Sam was very kind and communicative (awesome customer service). I'd def recommend this place to anyone whose looking for a tasty and healthy Asian dish! I had the "meat lovers" that combined chicken and plant-based "meat" which worked out great for me since I don't like red meat (tastes just like the real thing)! Overall, I feel full, satisfied, and the food doesn't make ya feel lethargic!  They do use Doordash as a delivery partner, however, if you order via moonbowls' website you get access to better deals, however you can also order via DD (everyone loves options, right?)
