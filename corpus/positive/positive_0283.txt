We enjoy coming to this upbeat lounge. The staff is very friendly. When entering the vibe is modern and bright. They have tables and center sofa area, along with Wooden bench to wait for your drinks. They also have a digital game - the table involves you picking different screens. Upon entering you see on the left side of the wall a digital screen that moves screen to screen. it shows a visual of different kind of drinks. 
I order the same smoothie all the time - Taro smoothie with bubble tapioca. The size of the drinks are a good size.  If I am not mistaken- I believe we have visited teapioca every week. My other daughter and her boyfriend have made a pack to try a different smoothie/drink every time they visit. 
So far we  have tried: strawberry banana,honey dew,
Oreo cookie, jack fruit, mango and taro
I invite and encourage people to try these tasteful drinks.
