My fiance and I have been seeing Pitruco outside of Palumbo park almost every Thursday for a while now and decided that it was time to try it out.  There wasn't a line so we ordered right away.  It takes 15minutes for them to make the pizza so I would call ahead if the weather isn't great.  We decided to take a walk to Rite Aid and when we came back, it was ready.  We ordered the Soppressata Pizza and Radicchio Pizza.  We loved the Radicchio pizza.  The crust is thin, which I really like.  Definitely go visit Pitruco on a Thursday if you are in the area.
