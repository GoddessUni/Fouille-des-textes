Freaki Tiki is a great place to go and get a well made cocktail or ice cold beer for happy hour, they have great happy hour specials as well as a friendly attentive staff. It is rare for my beer to be empty before im being asked if I would like another one.

They have a lot of flat screen tvs as well as a huge projection tv, I have never missed a game ive wanted to see while there. They also have a full menu for almost anyones taste. The menu is generally bar food with a few unique items that you wont find anywhere else, and the pizza is made from scratch down to the sauce. 

It is a smoking bar, but with the ceilings as high as they are and the ventilation system they have in place you can hardly tell. They also have a DJ every night and the nightly specials are always great. Such as "sink or swim" on friday nights, for $12 it is all you can drink 9pm til 2am, can't find a better deal around. Definitely check out freaki tiki for a great night out or a nice happy hour place.
