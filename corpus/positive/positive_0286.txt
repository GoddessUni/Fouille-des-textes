Run by the same family who owns Malio's, Iavarone's is a gem in the north tampa Area. 

A group of us girls went there during the Christmas holidays. We walked into the old Tampa landmark and were instantly happy. We had a drink at the bar while waiting for a table. You could tell this is the type of place that locals and regulars come to. 

The menu is moderately priced and consists of your traditional Italian fare plus steaks. We all got a filet and I must say, for the Price, it was superb. I also really enjoyed their house salad that came with me meal. 

It's not located on a main thorough fare, which causes me to forget about it often, but the meal was quite memorable.
