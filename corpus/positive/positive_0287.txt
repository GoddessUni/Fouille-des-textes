Ended up in Santa Barbara (one of my favorite places to overnight) and the Habitat is two blocks from our hotel. I heard people raving about this place so I had to check it out. I had the simple charburger and it was really good! Nice size patty with lettuce and tomatoes. Next time if it is day and warm enough, I'll try their shake or ice cream. Also I will try the grilled albacore next time. Anyways, if you see one in your neighborhood and want to try something other than In n Out or Fat Burger, give this place a try.
