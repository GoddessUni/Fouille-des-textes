This was such a cute little place! 

I came to New Orleans for work last November and am now getting around to writing the reviews. 

I ordered the fried green tomatoes and chicken and dumplings for dinner. My boss had the crawfish pie.
- fried green tomatoes were okay. I didn't care for the batter on it. 
- the chicken and dumplings were just WOWWWW. Just imagine a really great chicken pot pie but instead of crust, you have ooeyy goooeeyyyy biscuits baked to perfection right in the skillet! The "pot pie" portion wasn't too thick, but oh so flavorful. The biscuits absorbed all the flavor just right and the dish came out piping hot. This also came with a small side of grilled veggies which was some of the best frilled veggies I had in Nola.
- I got to try some of the crawfish pie, and this was just okay. I thought it was a little salty and a bit heavy. 

The staff here was nice, no complaints. 

Overall, I would def recommend this place and def get the chicken and dumplings! This is one of my favorite things I ate in NOLA (at a very affordable price too!) and I would def come back.
