Made an old lady reservation for two at 6 p.m. on a Friday and am so glad I planned ahead, as the place was completely packed by 5:30. The food was flavorful, beautifully presented and exceeded my expectations. Tried 5 dishes on the menu and hands down, my favorite dishes were the cauliflower "65" and the smoked beet langos. I have no idea what kind of kitchen wizardry is going on behind the scenes to create the sauce for the langos without cream but it was a delight to experience! Also enjoyed generous pours of a dry ros√©... mmmmm. 

A great experience at V Street. The only minor downsides to my experience were 1) the super flat/disengaged server we had (giving her the benefit of the doubt that she was having a really bad day) and 2) the fact that the restaurant only honors happy hour deals at the bar.

I will definitely be back for the food.
