I came here wanting something a little more 'healthy' after binging on some heavy, fried New Orleans food the days before. The Daily Beet was perfect.
I ordered the green juice and the Avocado Toast Supreme. You can tell all of the ingredients are extremely fresh. The juice was exactly how I want my green juices-light, fresh, nothing too strong and nothing too sweet. The Avocado toast was extremely filling and hearty, yet made with all fresh and delicious ingredients. The small green salad on the side was high quality and great. My egg was cooked perfectly, and I especially loved the chimichurri sauce.
The prices were very fair for the quality of food served here. I'd love to try some of their bowls, but I wasn't starving (thanks to the beignets I ate right before coming here). 
I would highly recommend Daily Beet, and St. Roch market in general if you want to get away from the New Orleans craziness. There are a ton of great eateries in this cute little market. It was very quiet at 9-10:30am on a Tuesday
