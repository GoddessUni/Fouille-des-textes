A friend recommended Hattie B's Hot chicken, since I'm from California. The line was out the door but expected since this is a 5 star. The line didn't take very long which was great. Got in a surprisingly there was seating which I did expect because the line was long... but that place is big. I ordered the SM white which included a chicken breast and wing (flavored Hot), 2 side orders, toast and pickles. The Hot flavor was just perfect not as spicy as I thought it would be. I ordered mac n' cheese and baked beans for side orders... they were perfect as well. The mac was soo creamy.. mmm thinking about it.. wishing I had more. Lol. Definitely enjoyed the service, timing, and food here. Great place and definitely somewhere I'd come back to if I visit nashville again. Thanks Hattie B's!!
