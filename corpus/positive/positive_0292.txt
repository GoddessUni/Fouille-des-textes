seeking for a byob, and not a hoity toity restaurant i quickly got on my yelp app on my iphone and slimmed everything down to one $. 

the jersey shore looking fella providing service was nice, and patient (i have one of those sally (when harry met sally) ordering friends). 

I ordered a fresh green salad with chicken, about 5$ a lobster bisque 4$ and a hot tea (i didnt ask for honey but i dont think they do). 

we pretty much wanted to just take a couple of shots of hennessy and the guy said we could but was murky about the legality of the whole thing, he kinda gave a shoulder shrug, however the place was not necesserily prepared with shot glasses (who woulda' thunk it!) but we used little dipping containers which did the job.

 the soup was not exactly a biqsue, not thick enough, but was pretty good, the salad was great, of regular size (a bit smaller than say fresh works, but also cheaper) and the chicken was nice and a not-ripped-off hearty amount of it. 

all in all, it's a small dining room, with additional window seating, but a great place to grab quick food, which is what we were looking for, and in addition, if you wanted to bring your own beer with you, or take shots out of dipping cups, well there you go!
