We tried Bernini's since it's a non-chain place in a part of town, Ybor City, we had been hoping to see on our visit to Tampa. Before I discuss the restaruante, I have to say that Ybor City is a place seeking an identity. We were pan-handled by a couple of homeless men and dismayed by the number of vacant storefronts. It would appear that Ybor City will be of interest to you only if you are a cigar smoking person in search of a tattoo. I've heard it is also a place for music but all the places were closed on the Monday night we visited.

Now to Bernini - our party of six arrived around 8:30 p.m. and the place was nearly vacant. We were greeted, seated and attended to by a knowledgeable waiter who was training a new waiter. We ordered two pizzas, two pasta's, and short ribs. Baguette style bread was very good and after being devoured quickly, was replenished without having to ask.  The salads were good - the ceasar had just a thinly sliced toasted piece of baguette rather than croutons, but the right amount of dressing. 

Our special pasta of the day was seafood orzo with black and green olives, capers, and red peppers. It was excellent! The three types of seafood were plentiful - our request to share was greeted with plates being separated in the kitchen. The pizzas were great. Made in a wood fired oven and of the very thin crust. If you like a hearty crusted pizza, this may not be your thing. The other pasta dish and short ribs got favorable reviews. We bought a bottle of pinot noir for about $30.00. The wine list is limited in selection but reasonably priced.

Overall, everyone of the party of 6 agreed that Bernini is above average and would be patronized again if we visit Tampa & Ybor City.
