I seem to laugh every time someone calls this place "My Nards."  Its "disdigg," arrogant quality just doesn't get old.  "We should go over to My Nards," etc.  But it's true, we should.  And do.

This place appears to be the area's new favorite bar to get pre and/or post-show drinks when going to the Rialto or Congress (especially if you're in the mood for a change from Congress' lobby/Tap Room or The District).  I haven't tried the food, but the bar's cocktails are fantastic and the market's sandwiches are simple, ready-to-eat and affordable (I do wish they'd ease up on the mayo, though, it makes an otherwise nice, light sandwich a total fatty boomba pig-out).  There's tons of wine in there, too.

If you're a fan of fresh basil, definitely hit the bar to try the Caprese martini.  It's like a little boozey salad in a glass, all pretty and garnished with basil, cheese and tomato.  They even drizzle the glass with balsamic tastiness.  So creative.

If you're scared of parking downtown, it's really not a hassle.  The free gravel lot just eastish of the 6th Avenue underpass pretty much always has space and is a 30 second walk from Maynards and Hotel Congress.  It's reassuring that there's always cops hanging out in their cars right across the street, keeping a watchful eye on the area's activities.

Get downtown!  It looks like there's some kinks to work out in this new place, but hopefully it'll stick around and flourish -- it's helping keep our city's interesting little heart beating.
