This is the most zen pizza place I've ever been to.  Simple but amazing menu.  Went with the family so we ordered the seasonal vegetable plate as an appetizer. It was delicata squash which is normally not one of my go to's....so this was turned into a magical dish.  We all loved this dish.  So beautiful and flavorful.   Then we tried all but the marinara pizza.  Hands down all of them were the favorite!  Impossible to choose the best!  They were ALL the BEST!  Had the chocolate and the olive oil cakes....soooooo delicious.   It was only days away from my birthday so I claimed this meal to be my birthday meal because...not sure it could be beat!
