We were finishing our dinner at a nearby restaurant, and when we were considering whether to get dessert there, the waitress leaned in and whispered, go to Hyppo.  We looked at her in surprise.  Yes, they have the best ice pops, she said. Before they opened a store in St Pete, she and her boyfriend used to drive all the way to St Augustine with an ice chest to get the ice pops there. 

With such glowing endorsement, of course we have to give it a try.  And boy, it really is good.  I love that most of the flavors taste so natural and so rich in fruit, it's like biting into the fruit itself.  I also love that it doesn't fill me up like a rich ice cream may, so it makes for a perfect ending to a meal, a little something sweet and cold.

We ended up going there every single day we were up in the area, that's how good it is.  I look forward to continuing exploring there many flavors.  So far, my favorite ones are: cantaloupe mint and pear reisling.  I tried the datil plum, and it was so spicy my lips feel kind of swollen! Still love it though.
