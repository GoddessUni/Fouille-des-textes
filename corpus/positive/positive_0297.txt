My boyfriend and I have the tradition of going to Chili's on valentines day! It started after our resos at another place fell through a few years ago and the only other place we could find that would take us was Chili's. We had such a good time there that we just stuck with it... it's our Valentine's Day place. :)

If you guys have open table I would definitely recommend booking in at Chili's. A lot of people don't know that you can make resos at Chili's and doing so will give you the 100 pts! Sometimes if we are feeling hungry after the gym, I'll quickly make a reservation at Chili's and get the points afterwards. Pretty simple way to get a gift card.

Chili's is tex mex, and it's decent! The drinks are pretty good and the service is good. I've never had a problem at any Chili's location and people seem genuinely happy to work there. I really like their cocktail menu and trying their concoctions! You know what else I really like at Chili's? The deserts.

One thing I would make people wary of is some of the entrees and deserts are served on hot plates. Let me tell you that these plates are not hot... these plates that came directly from hell. Do NOT touch them.
