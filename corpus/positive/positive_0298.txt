Pat's King of Steak or their rival, Geno's Steak? Each across the street from one another, I had both and the consensus with my two other companions made this one a clear cut WINNER!! The super tender and juicy steak is more chopped up. We added mushrooms, onions, green peppers and provolone. For me, the green peppers and the chopped steak did it for me. I also think the steak was a bit more juicier than the one at Geno's.

I think it's just a matter of preference. Both of these places deserves to be named Best Philly Cheesesteaks. How else would you explain people coming from around the world just to try it. It's been in many Food Network's shows. 

Come, enjoy and judge for yourself. It's worth a visit in the heart of Philadelphia.
