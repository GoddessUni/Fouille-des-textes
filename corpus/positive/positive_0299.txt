My boyfriend and I went here for dinner on a Friday night. I was willing to try it out because I've never been to a fusion Asian place, and I was willing to overlook the new business syndrome of being slowly serviced.

We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table, which wasn't bad compared to how busy they were. When we got to our table, the waitress presented a card with her name, which was great. We ordered drinks (Arnold Palmer limade & tea) and an appetizer (edamame). The edamame was a very large serving and was presented to us about 5 minutes after ordering. I didn't like my limade, so she made me a lemonade AP and didn't charge me for it! 

We ordered our food, and it got to us with the average waiting time for entrees, which was great considering it's a new place and they were very busy. I ordered chow mein (I asked to make it with just veggies, no meat) and my boyfriend ordered a beef noodle dish. Not only did it taste great, it had more veggies in it than I've ever seen in a typical Asian dish. My boyfriend loved his meal, and we ordered the banana roll for dessert.

This a great place to take people who aren't very into Asian fare. They have lots of Asian dishes as well as American dishes with Asian touches, like wasabi mashed potatoes and ginger glazed ribs. It's very Americanized, but maybe all fusion grills are. The decor was nice, the people very friendly. There are no vegetarian dishes so you have to ask them to make it so. At the bottom of the menu, they say they can sub tofu, but in my experiences with Asian cooking, just because it has tofu doesn't necessarily mean it is vegetarian. That's all I can really think about for a suggestion, is to say "vegetarian options available" or add a veggie submenu.
