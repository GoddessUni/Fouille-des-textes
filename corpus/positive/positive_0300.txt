This restaurant is one of my favorite eateries in the neighborhood. Whether I'm stopping in to eat a meal or dropping by to just buy a loaf of homemade bread to go, this spot makes me happy. 

The food is always delicious. The staff are always friendly and service is great. I love everything about the atmosphere - a small, intimate space with lots of natural light pouring into the dining area, with the  enticing aromas and sounds of the kitchen surrounding you. For some reason I feel like I'm at someone's home, and they're just in the other room preparing the meal.

The homemade bread is crusty and hearty. Sandwiches, soups, pizza bread, salads... everything I've had is tasty. This is definitely a happy place for me.
