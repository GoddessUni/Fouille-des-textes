Captain Crunch Toast, Bloody Mary Bar, drag show? Sign me up! Well.. not for the drag show. 

I stopped by Mad Donna's the day after Christmas for dinner and unlike typical brunch hours, had no problem finding a seat. We had the greatest server who was quick with drinks, orders and always so accommodating. As it was a Friday night, there was none of the typical fantastic brunch fare. However, it gave us the opportunity to try their mainstays. We ordered a selection of recommended things like the black bean chili, sweet potato enchilada, sweet potato fries, and the bacon avocado swiss burger. The black bean chili was not a good choice. I was really disappointed to see that the meat was very finely ground and overall lacking in the intense chili flavor I usually look for. However, the enchilada was spot on. Our server, who used to be a cook there, told us that it is a rather laborious process to make the dish. They batter the sweet potatoes in masa before flash frying them and then proceed to assemble the enchiladas. The enchiladas come in two with a side of black beans. The size was on the smaller size but they were mega stuffed and high in quality. Our last dish was the burger- I was pleased that they would make mine medium rare. ( Side soap box: It destroys me that restaurants should have any liability over someone getting sick off a choice they make. A little food poisoning for my deliciously rare steak. Wooorth it). Anyway, the burger was pretty good. Nothing particularly special. However... their sweet potato fries were aaaaaweeesome. And they came with this sweet chili dipping sauce that was great. 

Overall I enjoyed my experience for two reasons. One, service was fantastic. Two, those sweet potato enchiladas were fantastic. I will definitely have to come back to review brunch as that's probably where the money's at.
