This little shop is so cute, and the workers are so sweet! I came in to pick up an order I had placed and didn't realize they're cash or check only (usually I'm good about checking!). Wawa is right up the road if you make the same mistake I did. 

When I arrived, it was close to their closing time but they were still very patient and kind. When I asked about a certain candy, I was given a sample to take home and ohmygosh it was delicious. I'm still getting to know all of the local places in the area so I'm happy to say that this will be added to my list of go-tos!
