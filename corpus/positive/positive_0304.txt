The line moves quickly to get into this unpretentious restaurant satisfying your creole cravings. 

Service quick and friendly and great please-all menu with great prices. 

For two to share, we had the:

Side of shrimp creole

Cup of Seafood gumbo 

Side of garlic mashed potatoes

Blackened fish Po boy

Pecan pie with ice cream 

This came with a side of bread and with a couple of seltzers, the bill was $42 and we were very very satisfied! 

We got to try multiple creole dishes not filled with meat (we only eat fish) and they even have a nightly vegetarian creole special. No frills, no fuss food and home made bread. The blacked fish po boy was simple and the best of its kind I have ever had.
