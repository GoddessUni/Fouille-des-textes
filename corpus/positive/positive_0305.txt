Been wanting to try it out for a while and finally found myself outside their door at 4:30pm with time to kill, so I went in.  They were just setting up the dinner buffet so had to wait a few minutes while Taking got the serving spoons out. Meanwhile I studied the menu, which is quite replete with all the required Indian dishes and then some!  Alook was around to answer questions and Raj was busy setting up, while I grilled them on where they're from, etc.  My dinner was superb, and the Dal Makhani took me back to the Dhabas that I often frequented along the highways of the Northern plains of Himachal Pradesh and Punjab!  Please support these guys, they deserve to be successful.  The best thing is that now I don't have to go all the way to 34th avenue to pretend I'm back in India again!
