We have consistently been going to Twisted Fork since it opened several years ago and it has never failed to impress us.  The food is both delicious and unique. Our favorites off the new menu include the Pan Roasted Salmon and the Orange Bread Pudding (to die for). The salmon is cooked perfectly and the one time it was a undercooked, the manager kindly brought out a new salmon and comped our dessert, an exemplary performance of great service, which many restaurants could learn from.  Thank you Twisted Fork for being our favorite neighborhood spot! You won't regret checking it out.
