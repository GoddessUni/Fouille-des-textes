Yesterday me and my daughter ate here for the first time the wings were delicious so flavourful and they will fry them extra crispy if you like many different flavors and they also have boneless ones to you can choose from grape blue or grape koolaid.
We also ordered the cheese fries with bacon but we didn't care for them that's not the right cheese sauce because it has a nacho flavor and that doesn't taste well with fries and the fries are not the right texture so I'm not sure how there frying them maybe another cut for the fries and we ordered the fried biscuits with your choice of honey powered sugar were to die for.
