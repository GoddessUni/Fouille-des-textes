I have been wanting to stop in for some time, but I kept forgetting it was here.  It is kind of hidden on the end of a small strip  mall.  But now that I've been, I won't forget it. 
Wow, this is the most colorful place I've ever eaten.  Very cool. If you need a fun place for dinner alone (as I was tonight) or with a group, check this out. 
I came about 7:30 on a Tuesday night. There were only 6 other diners inside and 2 on the patio.  I sat at the bar and had pretty good service. Chips came out instantly. They were ok. (Better than La Hacienda, not as good as On The Border.). The salsa was ok.  (Not as good as La Cantina). The Chori Queso dip was very good.  In addition to their fountain drinks, they have several Jarritos flavors. Having a Jarritos with my Mexican food always enhances the experience. 
Unlike some of the other reviewers, my food service was very quick.  I had the Arroz Con Pollo Supremo (chicken, bacon, chorizo) and it was very good. It was served with warm flour tortillas which I liked. Better than eating it with a fork. 
I really didn't find anything not to like. I'm sure I'll be back.
