So I came here on a whim a Saturday morning a couple months ago there was actually a farmer's market in the parking lot I decided to give house red a try let me tell you awesome awesome awesome I got so much stuff out of there that I was awarded a day old loaf of bread because of my purchase was so large I got 3 loads of their cinnamon raisin bread to make French toast which let me tell you was amazing and then they had a raspberry type cinnamon roll I was bigger than my hand and it has covered in the very nice frosting is also great that you're rewarded with day-old up shouldn't sell for large purchases and they do have the old options because they are a little bit expensive. 750 to $9 for a loaf of bread is really high but you're getting the quality that's worth it I highly suggest if your breakfast Aficionado that you visit the store and get a loaf of their cinnamon bread drain should in eggs with cinnamon and Nutmeg and fry that puppy up you're going to have the most best French toast you've ever had five stars great job guys keep up the good work
