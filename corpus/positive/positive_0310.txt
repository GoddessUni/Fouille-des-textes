Favorite Mexican Restuarant! I have been going here a lot lately. I really like the fajitas, enchiladas, arroz con pollo & more. The chips are pretty good when fresh. The salsa isn't really anything too special but it's okay. The queso is pretty good when it's thick and not runny. Unlike, most reviews on here I usually receive good service. Waiters have asked if I was ready to order pretty quickly, food always comes out super fast, and I always get my check in a timely fashion. Definitely have gotten best service on a Monday night when they were slow. Also the only Mexican restaurant I know with a few American waiters
