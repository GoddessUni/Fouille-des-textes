Food was great; the place itself was a combination of comfy and eclectic; the Bloody Mary w/ the Stout palette-cleanser was genius... but what really struck a chord with me was the staff and their customer-engagement, their positive-energy, their ability to deliver an overall "experience".  My girlfriend and I had just gotten engaged the day before; we stopped off at Prep & Pastry on the way back to the airport... can honestly say that the staff there not only made us feel "at home", but went several extra miles to ensure we had a great time... having brunch. :)  So, yeah... would give them 17 starts if Yelp would allow it; but I guess 5 stars and this review will have to suffice.  We'll be back there for sure.
