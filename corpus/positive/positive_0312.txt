Great experience at White Limozeen! Here in town for a bachelorette party and this was a must-have-to stop! It is completely decorated for Christmas and such a sight to see!

I ordered a Queen of the Rodeo which was delicious! A little strong and tart but very yummy. We also had the Fancy Nancy champagne Jell-O shots. They were so pretty but unfortunately tasted not so good. I've had my fair share of Jell-O shots but I could only have a small bite of these. They were not my cup of tea but that's ok. They had a beautiful presentation and I really just wanted the pic! Lol

Lots of cute areas to take pictures. The outside rooftop area was super cute too. A little expensive but it was a very good experience to hang out with my girls and take some cute pictures!
