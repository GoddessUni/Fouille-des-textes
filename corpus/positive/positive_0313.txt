Dined here on Christmas Eve and it was very nice. Although I was a little thrown off that it was attached to the mall, it proved to be very nice. Our server was on point, she was lovely. 

There were 5 of us and we all gorged and it was all delicious. To start, the drinks - YES! There was this cucumber mojito type cocktail and I could have bathed in this, fresh and delicious. The Heirloom tomato salad to start was so flavorful. It was nice after I ate basically an entire loaf of their bread as it came right out of the over, YUM!

All the meat cuts are shown to you as they verbally explain the menu and specials, even a live lobster, felt so bad for him! I went with the filet and it didn't stand a chance next to me, I almost licked the plate. All the sides are for sharing, the two that stood out to me were the garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms.  

We had the lava chocolate cake for dessert, yup! 

Overall great experience.
