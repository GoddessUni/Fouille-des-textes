This place was pretty great. I was amazed with how they were allergy free. (No gluten, nuts, etc.). First glance inside it looked very hip. I came here expecting just a simple salad but i got a lot more! I was excited to see that they have fresh food that changes every single week so that's something awesome that is worth checking out. My boyfriend decided to get a full salad with a. Lemon honey vinaigrette dressing, which was very very good (The salad is $10 by the pound).  I decided to get the combo meal ($10.95) which came with a few more options as well as a salad. You got a half salad, two sides & a protein. I went with a more simple dressing that i knew i would like which was the balsamic & it was very good as well. The sides that i chose were a tomato avocado chickpea salad,  cooked cabbage with tomato's, & as the protein they had a vegetarian option which i chose & this was a potato patty. The tomato avocado chickpea salad was pretty good but I am not a huge huge fan of tomato so this wasn't my favorite but it was very very fresh. The cooked cabbage & tomato was absolutely delightful. I loved every single bite & honestly i wish i could have taken more with me!! The potato patty was so good. I don't think I've ever had a potato patty with as much flavor as this one did. Especially one that is gluten free. I was extremely impressed with this places food. 

The inside was very cute & picnic like. Plants everywhere. The food was served on a paper plate/ to go box that was biodegradable which was super epic!! Their silverware was plastic but they encourage you to recycle it all after you eat ( they have a bin for the biodegradable plate & food you didn't finish & then a separate one for the recyclables) 

The bathrooms were super super tiny but very clean. 

I would recommend this to anyone who has allergies or anyone who doesn't. You wouldn't be able to tell a difference!
