This restaurant is located in what once was a house on Meridian Street. It is extremely welcoming and the interior gives off a historic-but-trendy vibe. I went with a larger party and was seated at a corner table where it was a little too dim for my tastes. 
Staff was friendly but our waitress seemed a little confused - she had to come back to the table a few times to clarify our orders. Why not just write it down in the first place? The menu is eclectic - a little bit of everything different. I got the wild boar bolognese and it was very good.
