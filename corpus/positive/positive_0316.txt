We stayed here two Easters ago for a long weekend. Our room was really spacious and we loved coming "home" every evening to a fully turned down room, complete with bedside cookies and waters and classical music softly playing in the background. We also enjoyed the afternoon refreshments in the lobby and found the valet parking guys out front to be very polite, even though we were constantly in and out. The bathroom was very large and had Molton Brown bath products.

We also ordered in room service for Easter sunday brunch and everything was delivered quickly and cooked well. The biscuits were great.
