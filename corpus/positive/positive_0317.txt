While visiting Indy from the DC area, I tried Zest for Sunday brunch after getting a recommendation from a friend.   The restaurant is very hip and trendy.   The wait for a table was longer than I liked, so we opted to eat in the lounge/bar area.   Really good lounge set up for socializing, but not for eating.  

I ordered the Creme Brulee French Toast and LOVED it.   The only thing I didn't like is that they didn't make Chai Tea Lattes.  Brunch spots HAVE to have those.  I opted for grapefruit juice instead.   My fiance didn't really enjoy his meal, but hes picky, so that isn't factored into this review.   Had they had Chai Tea  Latte and taller lounge tables, I would have given them 5 stars.
