Wow, damn tasty meal!

I almost passed this place by--the entrance is off of a courtyard, so pay attention as you're walking by.

The good: service was impeccable; my Bombay Sapphire & Tonic strong like Popeye (and only $7!); the foie gras torchon was SUPERB (rich, smooth & creamy, & buttery; it's served with a house made jelly, poached apple, & large croutons); the mustard & herb crusted Pork Chop was simply amazing.  Smoky and tart from the crust; cooked a perfect medium.  I wish I were alone in the room because I would have gnawed on the bone at the end of the meal.

The bad: not a fricking thing.

BTW, the portions are huge.   HUGE, Jerry.
