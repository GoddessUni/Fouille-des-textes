If you're in Boise and looking for fun, the Balcony is where it's at. Whether you're gay, straight, transvestite, nerdy, hip, ghetto...you'll love it there. The music is terrific and plays to what the crowd wants. If you go on a night when there are more older people they'll be playing Michael Jackson and the good dance classics. If you go on a night when it's just us youngsters then they'll be playing the newer stuff like Kesha, Adam Lambert, Lady Gaga, and other new dance music. 

Every song it seems is one you can dance to and even for people like me who are terrible it's a welcoming atmosphere. No matter how you dance you don't feel judged and the bartenders are super friendly. 

There's one in particular, a shorter guy with a tribal tattoo on his arm. He's ridiculously handsome and incredibly sweet. 

If you don't dance there are pool tables, cheap drinks, and a beautiful outdoor view. 

I highly suggest the Balcony for everyone, of every age who wants a great place to hang out on the weekends.
