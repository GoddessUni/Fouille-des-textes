I've had a few arguments about their choice of bread for the burger. Checkers -- not to be confused with the fast food chain -- serves their burgers in pita, which is admittedly odd. But the pita offers just enough structure to hold the lettuce, pickle, etc, and the burger, without getting your hands too messy - at least to start! Since Rossi's bailed, Checkers is hands-down, The Best Burger in Trenton, and one of the best in the area. Actually, the Checkers Burger might be as good as the Rossi Burger (blasphemy?), just not as large. Which is fine, since it's still totally filling.

They offer other pub chow: sandwiches and fries and stuff. But get the burger. You can get it on a kaiser roll if you're offended by the pita, but you have to ask for that. Personally, I like to cooperate with the cook, and if he suggests the pita, I'm totally going with the pita.

I'm generally a purist when it comes to burgers, but Checkers makes a bleu cheese burger that is really really awesome. It is so good. Especially in a pita.

A couple of caveats: service is a little slow -- but worth it. And, it's a small shop that gets very busy during the week at lunchtime, so you can't expect to get in and out. Checkers is just a short walk from the State House and other government offices, and the state employees certainly know what's what! 

The waitresses are great. And, there's a full bar, if you feel like you need a little strength to finish off the rest of your day.

Everything is reasonably priced, too.
