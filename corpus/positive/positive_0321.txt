This is my first review but I've lurked yelp for years.  I moved to indy from Louisville last summer and have been generally disappointed with the lack of 3rd gen coffee shops in the city.  FoundryProvisions is teetering on changing my opinion and gives me hope for the city.  This place has the appropriate vibe, eg deathcab pandora radio station, the counter knocks of baristas actually tamping the espresso, comfy/mod chairs, industrial art plastering the walls, a swirling mix of pleasant pastry smells wafts thru the air and catches your nostril's attention and piques your stomach's imagination, there are folks in business suits, hipsters with their colorful socks, lots of folks walking from the neighborhood, friendly/intelligent baristas, cappuccinos served in 6oz cups (duh).  This shop was long overdue in indy.  Will be back.
