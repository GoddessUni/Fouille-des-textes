So glad I discovered this little joint. This place is really easy to miss, but it's certainly worth a stop if you're nearby. They use only fresh, local ingredients to craft their wholesome and delicious dishes.

The ambience is very nice; this place has a warm, homey, organic vibe to it. It was relatively busy, and smelled fantastic! I ordered Megan's Famous Rueben (without pastrami), and my guests ordered the Greek Salad with the homemade soup. We also got an almond strawberry jam bar.

The plates came out promptly, and they were all FANTASTIC! My meatless Rueben was amazing; the sauerkraut was fresh, and the Swiss cheese was local. There was also a very interesting sauce that had a slight spice to it. My guest's salad was also very satisfying; the lettuce was fresh, and the feta was rich and creamy. The dressing that came with it was had a very good consistency to it as well. The soup might've been the star of the meal; i can't explain any of the flavors in it, but it was a very yummy, subtle comfort food. The jam bar was also delectable. It was one of the best bars I've ever had! Highly recommended.

I will definitely be back!
