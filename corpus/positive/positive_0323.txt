After an intense craving for breadsticks, my fianc√© and I decided to dine in at Olive Garden on a Saturday night. Despite the website saying there was no wait, we ended up having to wait about 15 minutes (not bad!). 

Our server was great and our food came out quickly. We split a red blend bottle of wine that was only $15! We both ordered chicken alfredo and our food came out piping hot. The breadsticks and salad were just as good as I remembered. We also split the Zeppole, which were delicious. 

Overall, it was a great experience back at Olive Garden for the first time in a while!
