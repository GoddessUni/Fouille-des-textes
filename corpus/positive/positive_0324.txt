My friend loves this place and I've always wanted to try it. Today was the day! So many choices...

I chose to have my tacos on lettuce vs. tortilla. The portobello, carne asado, miso fish and Baja fish tacos. I didn't love the miso fish taco, it wasn't bad but I didn't love it. 

The waiter brought me a duck one to try because he swore it was amazing and I was like no thank you. It came out and was amazing! Get it! You won't regret it. I don't even like duck and it was amazing. 

The trio was delish! The guacamole is amazing! 

I cannot wait to go back and try the cauliflower and brussel sprouts. 

Street tacos that are no joke!
