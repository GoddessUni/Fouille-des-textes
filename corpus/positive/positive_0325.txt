This place is super cute and makes me feel hipster. The menu is quite eccentric and I had a bit of trouble figuring out what to get. I got the acai bowl and it was very interesting, but delicious. It had some granola on one side, berries on another and then a dripping of almond butter in the middle. I was a bit skeptical at first but each bite with each topping was different and I liked it more and more as I ate it.

The restaurant is fairly small and doesn't seat that many but we ended up sitting at the bar looking out the front windows. 

It was a bit pricey too. My acai bowl with tip was a little over $16. I love vitality bowls too for acai bowls and I thought that was expensive, but this was nearly 1/3 more of the price.
