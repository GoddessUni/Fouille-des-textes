Went here the other day after visiting doylestown. This place is perfect for groups or dates. Every single beer selection tasted good, except for the abbey tripple. My friend and I ordered a beer each and lived out choices. We then realized the best thing to do was to order the sampler with was a six ounce sample of each beer. It was the best thing to do even though we did it backwards. Do the sampler and decide what you prefer. You'll like them all so good luck with your choice. The place also had a couple pool tables and plenty of seating. It is also the kind of place were you won't mind standing around. Overall a perfect place.
