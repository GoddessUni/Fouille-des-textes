I'm stuck in Tucson for Business and was desperate for a decent Vegan meal. I was pretty optimistic when I found a Mexican food restaurant that also happened to serve Vegan options.

I walked in to find a clean and welcoming establishment. I was instantly greeted and, when it was revealed that I was a first-timer, I was walked through their menu options. 

The place is set up like a Chipotle style eatery. You pick from a bowl, burro, torta, etc. For Vegan options, you get to pick two different main courses. I got the Seitan Fajitas (made in house) and the Sweet Potato mix. The Cilanto rice was a little mushy, but still had a great taste. The server (And maybe the owner?) made suggestions on salsas and vegan cream flavor combinations that would enhance the meal. The differing flavors from the fajitas and the rice was  authentic , fresh, and had just the right amount of spice. If my Nana opened a Chipotle (and also happened to be vegan), I'd imagine it would taste a lot like this. 

The staff was very personable and very accommodating. I'll definitely be back as long as I'm in the Tucson area.
