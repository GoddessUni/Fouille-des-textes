I've lived in Nashville for four years, but never made it to Green Hills Grille until last night. I have a dear friend who frequents the restaurant and rants and raves about it constantly. Lucky me, I finally got to go with her!! 

So, so, so good!!! I had the rib rolls and they were delicious: served with a generous helping of prime rib on the little sliders, topped with cheese and a side of mild horseradish sauce and au jus!! The buns were soft, and the meat, juicy!! I opted for the fries, skinny fries are my favorite!!! Fries aren't really skinny I suppose. They're the shoestring kind, but feel better about calling them skinny fries! Ha!

I watched all the other plates walk by and noticed the desserts too, and saved some room... because actually I noticed the desserts on the menu before I even ordered my entree. And knew I wanted to try the carrot cake or strawberry shortcake 

After almost eating everything on my plate (ok, tried to save room, it was too good and hard to stop!) , our sweet server Ron walks out with the strawberry shortcake, and I knew for certain that's what I wanted for dessert: a mound of strawberries atop ice cream and a biscuit barely visible under the whipped cream... I eyed that thing, wondering which table it was going to. Ron set it down right in front of us... and I was like, did he read my mind, did he hear me say that's what I wanted, I asked him and he responded, "I just heard you say this was your first time here! Enjoy!" 

And I guarantee it WILL NOT BE MY LAST!! 

Impeccable, friendly and attentive service. Beautifully lit outdoor seating. Delicious, generous servings of food.... and that strawberry shortcake... just YUM!! 

I wonder if today is too soon to go back!!??
