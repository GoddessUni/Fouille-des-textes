Good hot chocolate...as in, chocolatey, not sweet.  You add the sugar to your desired sweetness yourself.   Yay!  I love the chocolate croissants, too.  However, the prices are a little steep.

Atmosphere is airy, lots of light.  It's not a place to park your butt with your laptop to work for hour after hour, though.  Paucity of outlets means a short stay.

One other issue:  the cafe could make it clearer where customers are supposed to "bus" their cups and saucers when they are done.  I don't mind busing my own dishes...and anyway I prefer that to watching dishes pile up on tables until a busy staff gets a chance to clean up after over-entitled customers.
