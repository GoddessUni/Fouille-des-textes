I'll be honest - I've only been to this place once not on a Sunday. I am a big sushi fan, and Forty Five Degrees gets it right, but knowing that I can get everything I want half off on Sundays means there is no reason to go any other day of the week!

If you do happen to check it out on a Sunday, expect a wait. We try to head over late afternoon and squeeze in at a spot at the bar, but if it's a nice day (hard to come by lately) or there is some sort of event downtown, expect to wait at least 30 minutes. The wait is well worth it, though. Once you're seated, the sushi is half off and delicious. I agree with others on here who have mentioned the Mount Fuji Roll - it is pure fried bliss!

Of course, since it's half off, you can't take any leftovers, so order wisely! We always end up with a few extra rolls, but since it's half the price, it's worth it!
