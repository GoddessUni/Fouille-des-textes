My friends and I used to come here every New Year's Eve for many years then we took a break. I think the last time I've been to this location was 2012. Although it's been a while, the food is still great! A bit on the pricy side now, but great. 

Janelle was our waitress today and she was awesome. We were having a girls dinner and she might as well had been one of the girls. So nice and great customer service. 

Now the food! Everything is served family style so bring your appetite and be ready to share. I got the salmon sorrento and it was Amazing. I paired it with some of my friends chicken carbonara, and could only get through one plate. I took home yummy leftovers. They also have a house red blend wine, Rossa. You will want to get a bottle to go if that was an option. So good!
