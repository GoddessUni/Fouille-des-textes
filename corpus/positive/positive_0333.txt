I absolutely love this place. Great Atmosphere, Great food and, Usually great service! 

I can understand the complaints about the salt content, but seriously people if you look at the nutrition info and still decide to go don't complain about it. Also if you only go a limited amount of times I think a spike in salt intake is fine for most people. 

Anyway back to the review. My wife and I love P.F. Chang's, I personally have been to over 9 P.F.Chang's from California to Memphis. We actually plan our vacations around where we can go to a Chang's. We are going to Florida next week and will be going to the Chang's there.

I have mostly gotten great service from this place and when I didn't I sent an email to the Manager and he has actually sent us out some kind of compensation that was not requested from him. 

I have had a bad experience where again having a kid and ordering water to drink gets you the most ridiculously slow and inattentive service imaginable.  The lady was actually a different person to the table directly behind us, all chatty and telling them about the menu and the specials, then she would come to our table and say two words or nothing and leave.

On to the food, I personally have to admit I am a comfort guy and stick with a few items, One is the Chang's spare ribs, they are to die for another is the Chicken lettuce raps OMG. I love the Honey seared chicken and Mongolian beef. I actually tried a lemon scallop dish last time I went and loved it. My wife loves the Sweet and sour chicken, nut I think it is a little plain and average for my tastes.

I am usually able to get out for around 40-45 bucks with an appetizer two entr√©es and possibly a small dessert. 

I think if you go here expecting to pay Chinese buffet or hole in the wall Chinese prices you are in for a sticker shock but I really do think for a good date night without the kiddo you should be fine and have a great time, just don't think it is going to be under 20 Bucks.
