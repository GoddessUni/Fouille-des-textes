If you have to have pizza, this is how you do it. It goes down easy, and doesn't leave you feeling greasy or sick like most of the other options in Reno. The folks working there are always pleasant. If they can't help you right away, they'll apologize, and let you know it will be just a few moments.  

There is a wide verify of drinks,sodas, and sides to go with your pie. I've been going there for about 3 years and haven't been let down once. all the sides, including the wings are great with the pizza or even as a snack with your beer. 

If you haven't gone, go... go go go.
