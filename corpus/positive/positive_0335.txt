I enjoyed visiting this place, very close to where I was staying, the Lion's Inn on St. Charles.  Went with my lady, we're old geezers at ages 45 and 48 and still enjoyed this place, got there pretty late around 12:30 or so and left around 3pm.  This place was much more divey than appears on the pics and that's fine.  A younger, hipper, artsier crowd and pretty friendly.  We enjoyed being able to smoke and the drinks were pretty reasonable and the service pretty dang good.  Didn't try any food, but heard good things about it.  This would be a regular spot if I were to live in New Orleans, our kinda place.
