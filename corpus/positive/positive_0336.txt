AMAZING.  I had never been to a place like this before visiting ViZion for my first time but I heard about it through my sorority and figured I'd give it a try as I love healthy alternatives such as the protein shakes they offer.  My favorite is the Birthday Cake - it tastes like a 2,000 calorie milkshake but it's healthy, and has sprinkles!!! The staff has always been so friendly and it makes every trip to their place a very enjoyable one.  I always ask questions and they are very helpful with informing me about the benefits of their tea and aloe drinks, as well as what exactly they put into their shakes.  They even started offering a "Happy Hour" which makes everything about $2 off and it's a great place to go after a workout if you want to have something healthy and fill you up as much as a normal meal.  Will continue going back for a long time, and want to keep trying new flavors!
