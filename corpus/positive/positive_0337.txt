Johnny's is a must visit in New Orleans. With lines out the door from late morning until closed it can get very claustrophobic but if you have the tolerance it is well worth feeling like an unoiled sardine. The menu is a vast array of every possible sandwich combination offered in NOLA. If it can be caught in the gulf, pulled from a bayou or raised on a farm they have it between two pieces of bread. I went with a crawfish po' boy in my head and wound up getting an oyster one instead. I was happy I did. I had never truly appreciated oysters until I had them fried and stuffed in to French bread dressed. Johnny's is worth a.trip to New Orleans in its own right.
