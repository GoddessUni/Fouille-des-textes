An absolutely stunning restaurant located in an old mayoral home in Nashville! We started out on the back patio, but when a sudden storm blew in, we were quickly moved inside. Both areas were comfortable and beautiful. We had the bok choy for an appetizer. It was incredibly juicy and the cheese on it was amazing. For the main course, I had the chicken--I usually don't eat skin if served on the chicken but the crispy skin was outstanding. My friends got the pork loin (so tender!) and the shrimp and grits. For dessert, we shared both desserts: the strawberry cheesecake and the banana sundae. The cheesecake was crust less and served in a pan. I'd never seen anything quite like it, but I could've eaten the whole thing myself. The banana sundae was a winner too--creamy banana ice cream, chocolate, and peanuts, what more could you ask for? 

Excellent service too!
