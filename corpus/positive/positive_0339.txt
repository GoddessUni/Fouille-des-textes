A group of coworkers and I went to Stacked Pickle for lunch on a weekday. It was mostly full, but we had a nice table separated from the fray by the door. College basketball games were on, and we had three tvs within viewing range.
I found the table service to be fine, wasn't bad at all.
I had a Cuban sandwich. The flavor and the pulled pork were very good, hot and fresh. As others have stated, the French fries are awesome - are they lightly beer battered?
The serving size of my sandwich and my fries were a little bit smaller than I would have liked for the money, but I guess that helps with portion control.
This is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat and chat with friends. Not a place to go to on a date.
