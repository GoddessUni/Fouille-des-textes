Fantastic service and good food. 
I saw many reviews about the yuca. I've never had yuca so I gave it a try- it's delicious! It's like buttery, garlic mashed potatoes but has a root vegetable texture.  Very tasty. I also tried the plantains and crab appetizer. The crab was good but a little too filling for 1 person, be sure to share. It's was like a giant hush puppy with red sauce and crab inside. The plantains were like others I've had before but also good so no complaints. 
One note was that two people in my group frequent this restaurant and said the rice has "changed". It "used to be more flavorful" but this time was "bland and kind of dry". They both liked the rest of their meals (arroz con pollo and taste of ybor) though. 

They have Cigar City Jai Alai on draft so that was a plus! Oh and the olive butter that comes out with the bread is pretty good too!
