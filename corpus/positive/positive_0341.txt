Since the West End seafood restaurant scene of my childhood never returned after Hurricane Katrina, I have longed for a place with even a small semblance of the atmosphere and fresh tastes that I recall. I'm grateful that The Blue Crab Restaurant has met and exceeded my expectations! 

My parents and I just returned from a thoroughly enjoyable experience there. All of us were in agreement: WOW! We ate upstairs in the main dining area with its sunny, open and airy feel overlooking the water and passing sailboats. There's something particularly soothing and satisfying about eating fresh Louisiana seafood in such a delightful space. Our server, Cilver, immediately made me feel welcome with her unmistakably bright and friendly personality. She was helpful and patient and appropriately attentive to our needs. We just loved her!

We began our Fourth of July meal with the fried onion rings that were exceptionally tasty with a well seasoned and crispy coating, not greasy, covering the deliciously sweet, soft onions. For our main courses, my mother enjoyed the stuffed crab platter with a good amount of fresh crabmeat balancing out the breading in the mixture while my father and I enjoyed fried seafood. The oysters and shrimp were fried perfectly and coated with a lightly seasoned batter that allowed us to taste the fresh seafood flavors. The oysters and shrimp were of an eye-popping good size. All three entrees were generously portioned, leaving the three of us to ask for to-go containers. Finally, we shared my mother's choice of dessert, Alison's Double Dessert, a well constructed combination of fudge brownie and cheesecake with a cherry topping. It was warm, creamy, and not overly sweet -- a fantastic capstone to our delicious meal.

I highly recommend this authentic New Orleans lakefront restaurant not only for its ambience and tasty offerings but also for providing a contemporary nod to West End seafood history. Well done!
