Wow. This is one of those times you wish you could give 6 stars. Food was fantastic as our party of four shared 7 sushi special rolls each one better than the next - but the real reason for our incredible experience was the service. Our waitress Esther was extremely friendly, knowledgable about the menu, responsive and helpful. It's a BYOB and we brought a few bottles and they were very quick to bring a bucket of ice and opener as well as a martini glass for me . The party next to us had a birthday and they brought out a birthday cake for them at no charge!! Can not wait to go back.
