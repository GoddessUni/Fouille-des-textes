Located in the heart of a beautiful courtyard tucked away from State Street, this is a new husband-and-wife eatery that serves a mix of Vietnamese and Western fare.

When I stopped by, all the menu items looked appetizing, although I opted for the English breakfast because it looked the most substantial. It certainly was. In true English breakfast style, a smorgasbord of offerings: sausage, ham, baked beans, eggs, hash browns, veggies, and toast. Not bad for the $14 price and super tasty, helped by generous amounts of butter. If you're coming by with a group, then make use of the West/East offerings as an opportunity to try a lot of different things at once.

Service was super friendly and personal; someone who I believe was a chef-owner came out to check on me. The outdoor setting is particularly pleasant, regardless of whether we're in a pandemic. Thanks Yelpers for pointing me to this excellent local find as part of an on-the-go search of the Yelp app, just steps away from where I'd parked!
