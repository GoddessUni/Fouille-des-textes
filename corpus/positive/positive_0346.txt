The service is here beyond excellent. The staff are kind, fast and go above and beyond. The chips and salsa are decent, the salsa needs work. The salsa is lacking depth, I most taste jalape√±o, it needs more cilantro and lime juice.  The queso is good, as to be expected, I have never had a bad queso at a restaurant.  The guac is good, love the texture and taste, but I believe it needs more lime juice as well. I got the gringa fajita quesadilla which is filled with meat and veggies. It was seasoned well and loved how much meat you got for the price. The lunch meal comes  with rice and the typical salad. My mother got the chimichanga, she said it was good and was a pretty good size for the price, it also came with rice and salad. My friend got the el torito, which is rice topped with your choice of meat and covered in cheese sauce. He said it was good but needed just a tad more queso. Altogether this place is worth the trip over.
