Straight dope. Seriously. I walked in a little disappointed b/c my duder the Falafel Nazi decided to take the day off. I went to the counter and told the guy I'd never been here before but I was hungry. He let me try a falafel ball and some of the sauce. He had me. I ended up getting the Samantha platter. It was large and very delicious. 3 falafel balls, 2 roasted eggplant medallions, a latke, a whole wheat pita, hummus, hot sauce and diced tomatoes and cucumber. Everything is made in house and fresh. I'd come back again. Hell, next time I am bringing friends. Great service, great food, and good prices. Hollar.
