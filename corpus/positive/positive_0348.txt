This my second visit to Arroy Thai  in less than a month! Why? simply because it is better than over a dozen Thai places I  have had in Tampa! On my first visit, I ordered the Red Curry, plenty of flavor with the right consistency of sauce. I could tell they use fresh ingredients. On my second visit, I was more confident in their food that I ordered the soft crabs. It was delicious! Crunchy from the outside and melt in your mouth in the inside. And just for checking in on yelp, I got free delicious thai ice tea!! So if your picky about your Thai food like me, give Arroy Thai a try!
