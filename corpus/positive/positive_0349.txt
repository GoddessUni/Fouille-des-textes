We had so much fun here. On the Friday night that we were there, they began charging a cover charge at 7:00 (waived for military and first responders- thank you for supporting these brave people). We got there around 7:30 and stayed for a long time. The atmosphere is so much fun that we couldn't bring ourselves to leave. 

There are three floors, all with a view of the stage if you are interested in the live music (we loved the first artist on the night that we were there!). On the first floor, there is a huge dance floor and there are line dancing lessons in between live music sets. The dancing is fun!!! Even if you miss the lesson, it's easy enough to pick up by just watching others. 

I will say that we didn't order any food, so I can't comment on that. I did order a drink, which was expensive and heavy on the alcohol, but delicious nonetheless.
