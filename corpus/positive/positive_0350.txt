We've been coming to Venezia's for as long as I can remember and they've never disappointed! They've become our regular pizza destination every week. The service is always great, the two owners are as sweet as can be, and the food is superb. You can't really base your experience here off of the by-the-slice pizza, because it really doesn't do this place justice. 

Our favorite dish, by far, is the brooklyn pizza. You have to order the brooklyn and eat it fresh in the restaurant. It's easily one of the best pizzas I've ever had (and take-out doesn't do it justice. Eat it while it's hot!)
Another thing Venezia excels at is their cheesesteaks (or their hot subs in general). I've lived in the area my whole life and I'm definitely no stranger to the Philly cheesesteak. I have to say, their cheesesteak definitely ranks in my list of best cheesesteaks (even if it doesn't come with whiz). 
Other appetizers we've had that we love include ravioli, vodka rigatoni, any of their "parm" subs (chicken, meatball, veal, eggplant, etc), and lasagna. 

This place is easily one of my favorite to eat at and I would say is hands down the best pizza shop in Bucks County.
