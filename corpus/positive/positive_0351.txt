Holy cow. This place is so damn good. Decided to try this place out the other day with some friends and literally everything we got was delicious so let's dive right in. 

Ambiance: it's a nice restaurant, a touch small, but cute. There is both outdoor and indoor seating available. 

Service: good/great. All the workers were nice enough to answer my 100 questions about the menu lol. 

Main event: okay so now to the food. I couldn't decide what to get so after much debate a buddy and I split the surf and turf burger and the grinder. The grinder was my preferred dish because it allowed the lobster to shine a bit more and it was more light and refreshing. However my friend preferred the burger and with the awesome sauce on it I can't argue that. Just know that it was pretty heavy (obviously I mean it's lobster, beef, and cheese). Of the stuff the rest of the table got, someone else got the burger and he said it was definitely going to be his go to burger in indy, someone else got a pok√© bowl and enjoyed it, and another got the shrimp burrito and was blown away by how big and delicious it was. Rave views all the way around so definitely stop in!
