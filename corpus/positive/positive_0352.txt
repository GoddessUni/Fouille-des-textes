They are amazing altogether. I struggle with making decisions and every time I come in they are able to guide through my thoughts and give me the perfect combination.  I have been here only three times to sit in and eat and the food is given to you fast, the environment is so comforting and they have a GLOBE!!!!!!!! Who doesn't love a globe? Today they offered me a new drink that isn't on the menu and it was amazing. I have tried their breakfast options and one lunch option now all are to die for. I have had countless drinks and their flavors are amazing. I don't even really like hot drinks but the hot chocolate with a vanilla shot changed my life forever! Outside of the food the staffs interaction with each other and you, as a customer, makes you feel like family that's visiting the new home for the first time. I absolutely love it here. It's clean, comfortable, amazing food, amazing staff, amazing service.. I would recommend this place to everyone. Definitely a gem to have on this side of town!
