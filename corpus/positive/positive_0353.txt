If your looking for a normal grocery store to run in and buy bread and milk, no whole foods is it. If your not aware of the prices here, you will be bothered. However, the quality of produce, meat, and prepared foods is incomparable to another grocery chain. And actually, there house brand (360?) is actually cheaper on some items than at frys or Safeway. 
All that being said, this is much more about the experience. And everyone, from the managers down to the wait staff and super chill and friendly. The bar is a go to spot. Where else can you get a craft beer on tap and have access to an entire grocery store or goods? Not that you even need to leave the bar, the menu is great. The smoothies and fresh juices, also awesome. Really adds something to the area that you can't get anywhere else.
