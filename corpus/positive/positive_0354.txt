Cakes by Candace made our wedding cake and cupcakes and they were INCREDIBLE. We asked for a custom truck shaped cake, and not only did they get the rust and flat tire exactly like the photos of my husband's truck, but the cake itself was delicious. Moist, flavorful and leaving you wanting another bite (which is unusual for a carved cake)!

Our cupcakes were better than I could've ever asked for, and all of our guests were demanding to know who made them for us. We made special requests interms of decoration and flavors, and Candace came through in flying colours. My husband wanted Banana bread cupcakes, and I wanted rainbow cake and she made them better than i'd imagined. They were delivered on time and set up beautifully. 

If its your wedding or special event, I wouldn't recommend anyone else. Candace and her husband were wonderful to work with and delivered better than what we were expecting.
