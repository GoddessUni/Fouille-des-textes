An easy 5 stars...Greeted as soon as I walked in, handed a menu as well as their September specials, made my selection after a little help from the nice cashier, and had my order on the table in around 10-15 minutes. I opted for the grilled chicken club sandwich, which consisted of a perfectly cooked chicken breast and bacon strip, with monterrey jack, honey dijon, lettuce and red onion (hold the tomato) on a challah bun. It was great! And the price was right ($9.95). It also came with homemade chips, which were slightly crispy, slightly soft, tasted a little like Pringles. They were perfect too. And washed it all down with iced pineapple coconut tea ($1.95), which is a September only special - interesting! I didn't detect the pineapple but the coconut flavor was strong and it was quite refreshing (even better when I added the turbinado sugar). 

Service was on point. As I mentioned, my cashier was friendly, the other cashier (manager?) was also, telling me that my order would be out in a couple minutes, asking how my meal was, wishing me a good day, etc.  Seems like a large majority of the customers order online and pick up their meals or have it delivered.  I prefer to eat in the restaurant, which has a dozen tables and it's clean. The 80s music station they were playing was nice (and it was entertaining to listen to one cook sing along). Looking forward to my next visit!  Their pastas sound very tempting! And I like how they have new items each month.
