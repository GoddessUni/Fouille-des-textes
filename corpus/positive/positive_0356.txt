Whilst wandering about Spruce street before a trip to the airport- I decided I needed coffee, and I needed it now. I was going to go to my regular haunt, but realized that I didn't have time. Upon my arrival at the intersection of Spruce and 11th, I was pleased to see that there was in fact a wonderful coffee shop right before me. I had time for coffee! Awesome!

Walking in the charmingly quirky barista proved to be not only beautiful and friendly, but quit knowledgeable and passionate about their deep roasted, and finely procured coffees. Not only was she able to dash about behind the counter to aptly make each drink- but she did pretty designs on each cappuccino. Which is always a novel thrill. 

So the ambiance is pretty awesome. But really what matters is the service and the coffee. Both were STELLAR. Stellar I tell you! The fact that they have a conscious about from where there coffee comes, and how it gets to be is refreshing. major points for that! Then there is the quality of the coffee. It delivers a perfect jolt of caffeine, with a bold and earthy quality. I like the Organic Farmhouse blend- which is most often made by the cup. 

The only reason why I am giving 4 stars is because there is limited seating (though I hear there is much more available in the summer when they put out tables on the side walk....

If you're in the area, Spruce Street Espresso can not be beat.
