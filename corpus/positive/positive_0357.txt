If you are in New Orleans, this place is a must!!! Great for groups, birthdays, families, date night. 

We came here for dinner one night and oh boy, everything served to us was good! 

The restaurant is very big, don't let the store front fool you. 

We had reservations which we got seated right away. We ordered a bottle of wine, and some fried oyster and fried alligator to start with. Both which were good but u loved the fried oysters better. 

As for dinner I ordered the Rabbit and dumplings and it was super hearty and delicious. Something I'd eat more in the winter then something in the summer. He go the braised beef short rib on top of rice which was also hearty and delicious . As for sides we got smothered greens and cracklings (cracklings was a special order). 

For dessert we got pineapple upside down cake that came with a coconut lime sherbet which complimented very well. 


Staff was wonderful and sommelier was knowledgeable.
