My sister & brother in law advised my husband & I to go here for chocolate. I was having a craving so we went here. You walk in and the delicious smell of chocolate hits your face. In cases are different tray of delectable different chocolates and fudge. Fudge was by the pound, we got slices. The rum balls could probably get you drunk they were so strong! For all of the chocolate we got it was less than $10. The price is amazing and the chocolate is pure. Customer service is amazing. Greeted by everyone as we walked in even though they were beyond busy. Next time I'm in Plainfield I will be stopping by again.
