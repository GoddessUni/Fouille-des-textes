Sometimes it seems like America is little more than a dark conspiracy to keep me from buying good quality lettuce, fruit and fish.  Farmer's markets are the antidote, and this is one of the best.  Its only equal in Philadelphia is Headhouse.  

To me the highlight is "shore catch".  Unless you have a Samuals and Son hookup this is the best place -maybe the only place- to get truly fresh fish in Philly.  It all comes directly from their boats in Barnegat  NJ.  I usually go for their amazing yellowfin tuna, scallops or swordfish.  Their wild NJ oysters are the best Saturday morning breakfast on earth, and the cheapest way I've found to get world class oysters ($10 a dozen).  

Since the Hurricane two weeks ago they haven't been at the market... I really hope everything's OK...

Otolith Seafood is great too- flash frozen Alaskan seafood.  Sable, Sable baby.    

Z-Farms has some amazing produce.  Heads of Heirloom baby lettuce at the beginning and end of summer.  Heirloom Haricort Vert, dragon beans, wax beans, romano beans and green beans in July and August.  Mind blowing spinach and toscano kale in the fall.  

The spring mix the amish produce stand sells is amazing-- a huge bag of delicate baby lettuces for $2.75.  Their fresh Lima beans are great.

Try Beechwood Orchards for berries, cherries, plums, apples, persimmons, ground cherries, mini-kiwis, and paw-paws.
