I'm in the area a few days a week and drove by Penn Station the other day and thought to myself, "hey, I haven't eaten there in awhile." So, I decided to do something about it!

I ordered online before I left for the restaurant, wanting to limit the time that I spent inside waiting around. I ordered a regular sub and small french fry, and the estimated time for my lunch to be ready was about 15 minutes.

I arrived a few minutes before my order was supposed to be ready. The gentleman at the counter double checked the computer and made sure he had my order and said it would just be a minute for the fries. Super friendly guy and just like he said.. it was just a few minutes before my food was ready. As soon as it was, it was brought out to me. I had to ask for catsup but got several packets right away.

I took my sandwich back to my office to eat. Granted, it wasn't that long of a drive, but everything was nice and hot when I got into it. Sandwich was delicious... I honestly don't know why Penn Station isn't on my list of regular places like some other spots.
