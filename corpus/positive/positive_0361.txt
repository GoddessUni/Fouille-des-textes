I love going to the Limerick outlets!! Even though they are a half hour away it is well worth the trip and it always has great scenery! I also love the fact you walk outside to get to all the stores it is a great alternative to the mall! Limerick has a lot of great stores including an Adidas Outlet, Asics Outlet, Columbia Factory Store, Disney Outlet, Hot Topic, Nike Factory Store, Old Navy Outlet, and Sketchers to name a few of my favorite outlet's. This is of course in addition to so many more outlets I haven't been to yet! They also have a food court with Nathan's Hotdogs inside and they even have a Starbucks, Wendy's and Ruby Tuesdays in the outlets too! (This is separate from the food court). My favorite two outlets are Columbia and Asics they are the main reasons I come here to buy new Columbia merch (they are my favorite clothing brand) and to get myself new Asics shoes (my favorite sneakers). Even though I am able to make the trip a few times a year it is still a blast!
