Nothing hits quite like something from Philly Pretzels. Absolutely delicious!! If you have not gotten anything from this company, have you even been to Philly??

The pretzels are very cheap and you can get salted or a cinnamon sugar if you have a craving for some sweets. The best is when you get them and they are fresh out of the oven... absolutely heavenly! My boyfriend lives in New Jersey, but his grandparents live in Philly and his brother has made the drive down to Philly multiple times just to grab some Philly Pretzels. 

If you pick some up, only grab enough that you can eat within two or three days. After that they can go a bit stale and they are by far the best on the first day that you get them! I live in Cincinnati currently but anytime I am in the area, I always pick up a bunch for the drive back. Absolute must try!
