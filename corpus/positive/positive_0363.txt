My husband and I have been to this location before but this is the first under the new owners. The first notable change was the super friendly welcome- which felt neither practiced nor forced. We had an old fashioned egg platter with delicious nitrate free bacon and wonderful homemade toasted cranberry bread. The owners' committment to farm fresh translated really well to the platter. I was disappointed that the La Colombe was a light roast as I like the darker the better but it was fresh and smooth. The only reason why I didn't go the five stars is the amount of food for the 6.50. Plenty for me but not what the North Wales/Lansdale crowd would expect in comparison to other breakfast/lunch places in the area. We will definitely be back soon as there are a number of dishes (quiche looked wonderful) for bkfst or lunch that we want to try. I would go out of my way for the quality and ambience. Plus, there is a small set of table and chairs out front so you can grab a mocha and muffin and enjoy Main Street.
