THE ABSOLUTE BEST SEAFOOD in SOUTH JERSEY! In the 1970's Gloucester Citys  best kept secret was Max's Cafe. A tiny corner bar / restaurant with linoleum floors, Bad carpeting and Butt to Butt seating. The Patrons Were Friendly and the Seafood "THE BEST in The Tri -State Area". Their Signature dish was their Famous Mussels served on a Cafeteria Tray and 2 Kaiser Rolls to Sop up the Delicious Nectar! Like a fine wine, Max's Cafe just gets better with age. Caring New Owners Refurbed the interior with a Cozy Hardwood / Brick Interior, Beautiful Tin Ceilings and  Restored the Original Bar. The Menu became Modernized Still Keeping the Classics and Improving on them Such as the Mussels and the Fried Combo That Max's is Famous for. The New Menu boasts Fresh, Daily Specials that satisfy everyone from an "OLD SALT" to the Discriminating Gourmet. A Delicious Raw Bar Menu, Fresh Spring Mix Salads and Fresh ( NOT STALE!) Loaves of Bread. Max's Boasts an Extensive Wine and Spirit List. The Service is Attentive and Friendly! With all this and the place STILL keeps its "CHEERS" like atmosphere! If you're looking for the Best Seafood in the TRI-STATE area, treat yourself to Max's Cafe in the Heart of Gloucester City, NJ.! Max's is always quite busy, so my suggestion  is to use the Open Table Online Reservation system. It can be accessed through their website. It's Fast, Convenient, and Gives a confirmation within seconds.  Enjoy!
