I love the delicious catfish and fried okra! I am from Little Rock, Arkansas and when I was a child, my mother would slice okra, dredge it in cornmeal with a small amount of flour and fry it in Wesson corn oil. Yummy! She's slice onion rings and dip them in egg then flour and fry them and make some homemade Hush Puppies. She would serve them along with coleslaw with the fried catfish. Carolina Kitchen is the only southern style restaurant around that compares to the delicious food that I ate at home, in Arkansas.
The employees are all very courteous and helpful.
I recommend this restaurant.
Enjoy!
