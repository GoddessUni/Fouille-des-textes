The owner is super nice and very knowledgable, our first time in he told us about his background and how he's been a chef for 25 years and how he ended up opening this place. The food was delicious and very fresh! I'm super picky about my coleslaw and after trying his which is amazing I think I've been ruined for any other place. Wings were great! But I think my favorite thing was this steak salad I ordered it was outstanding. I love how perfectly cooked the steak was and thinly sliced which I loved because I hate getting a huge chunk of steak or chicken on a salad that's not well proportioned. He has some fun creative salads!! I highly recommend this place!! We've been back a few times and it's been delicious each time!
