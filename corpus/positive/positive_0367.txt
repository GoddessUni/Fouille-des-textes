This is THE best Mediterranean food in Nashville. It's very, very fresh. The owner and his family are super-nice too. I think I've met them all, but you never know because Greek families are huge. You've seen the movie. You'll want to call ahead for your order or go after hours because this place is slammed and pretty unorganized during the noon lunch rush. You'll probably want to get it to go too because it's very crowded, loud, and the flow of foot traffic is terrible. I saw a lady try to bring a stroller in there - took 10 people to get her kid to a table. That being said, great value, great food, great people.
