I've been on a chicken sandwich craze for  while now and have to admit that my expectations weren't high for this place but it was late and we were at the casino so, why not? Well I'm glad I did cus i ordered One of the best crispy chicken sandwiches I've had in a while! The chicken was cooked perfectly it was hot, fresh, and juicy. So good that I immediately ordered another one and thinking of going there again today! (Yup, I said it wanna fight about it?) 5 stars cus hey, it's "fast-food" and I only care about the food (Well the chicken Sandwich in this case) not the service.
