If you haven't tried Kahwa yet, you are sorely missing out.

This is a beloved local coffee shop chain that originated in St. Pete. I was ecstatic to see that a South Tampa location had popped up.

I'm an espresso fan and Kahwa's lattes have the perfect caffeine kick and the espresso actually has flavor. I love jus getting a cafe latte here...no flavoring needed! Plus they have almond milk! Take that Starbucks!

The staff is also super nice and genuine. The space is, we'll, spacious. Outdoor and indoor seating. Perfect place to meet up with a friend or set up shop to work for a few hours.

I didn't try any of the food when I was there, but e erythema I made fresh with local ingredients.

There's also a drive thru if you're in a hurry!
