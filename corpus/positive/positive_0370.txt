I've always been a fan of Iron Hill's food, and this place satisfied my expectations. Came for lunch, and we were so happy they were open as well as taking reservations. However, we didn't really need one since there were plenty of tables available. It seems you can sit indoors, since I saw at least 1 group inside seating. They have a huge beer garden/seating area in the back, which was really nice as well as a pleasant surprise. Service was great as always. Since this is my first time at this location and the first time I've been back to an Iron hill since months ago, there were menu items I was not familiar with. Ultimately, I had the Left Coast burger, and it was savory and refreshing; I definitely would recommend it. The drinks were mostly the same with a good selection and decent prices, but to be honest, I've never been a huge fan of Iron Hill's brews. Consider the King of the Hill membership if you come often, as all brews will go in this nice mug that has a tad bit more volume for the same price as a 22oz and it's a reward/point system, so you can earn $$.
