This was such an amazing dining experience. We called at the end of November attempting to get a reservation for the week of Christmas. We were told they were booked solid for a month and we should try back to see if there were cancellations. We were able to snag a lunch reservation for today (Christmas Eve) and were so pleased! Our table ordered mushroom risotto, quail, and shrimp & grits. Every meal was a winner. I tried a bite of each and couldn't decide who made the best choice. I especially loved their turtle soup. The base was very smooth with a bit of a kick. I had hot butter rum and the famous bread pudding for dessert. This is a must stop in New Orleans.
