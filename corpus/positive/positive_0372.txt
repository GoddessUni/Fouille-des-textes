I've been dying to try birria tacos for the longest time and finally did 2 weeks ago. I got a birria quesataco and birria mulita, chips and guac, and an horchata (watery). The first time I went, they didn't have the consome for dipping which was a real bummer but I'm giving them 5 stars cuz they are THAT good. Packed with flavor! The mulita in my opinion has more flavor but both are very good. Since that visit, I've gone 2 other times and had a mulita with consome each time along with their chips and guac. The mulita is a little harder to dip because it's a round tostada but I made it work. Lol. So so so good!! And the GUAC!!! Man, that guac is good. Packed with cilantro and lime (as it should be). Best I've had.

One tip, you might want to order ahead if going during lunch because they can get pretty busy.
