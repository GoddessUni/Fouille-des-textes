This is the onl.y place you can get a decent teraki tofu. It has a nice crispy crust, well cooked tofu. It is sweet, no added orange flavoring, just perfect.  The green tea was burned.  You can't prepare tea they way you prepare coffee. Tea leaves are more dleicate than coofee beans. The vegatavle rolls were good nad so was the sushi rice I had. Our waiter was nice and attentive. Parking was hard, especially with my suv. I thought I was going to hit all the cones.  This is the spot me and my best friend go to talk. It isn't to loud so lyou can have a good conversation.
