I would definitely eat here again...if I ever found myself in lord-knows-where, PA.  I was looking for a good sandwich shop to get a cheesesteak and the folks at the Homewood Suites pointed me in the right direction.  The cheesesteak wasn't greasy at all and has that awesome soft roll that you would never find in CA.  I ordered mine with shrooms and onions...and, f course fries.  It's both a shame and a plus that I live 2500 miles away.  With Fat Kid Food as good as this, I'd be 200 lbs within a year! The staff was super friendly and chatty(or nosy ;p)...plus they had the Red Sox game on the TV.  Two thumbs up!
