I just discovered this place by chance and apparently it's only been open a month or two. Unless you're familiar with the area, you're going to have trouble finding Pho 99. Pro tip: it's in the strip mall near Auto Zone.

I was in the mood for something quick and cheap, so I stopped in here for lunch. They have a really extensive menu of all of the Vietnamese faves, but as always, I was in the mood for Pho. I got the large #10 with rare steak and brisket. The portion was HUGE and I was hoping that it was all as good as it looked. Lucky me, it was delicious. The meat was perfect and the broth was full of flavor without being overpowering. I'll admit that I don't have most sophisticated palate when it comes to Pho, but I know when a bowl is bland and this one definitely wasn't.

Take it from someone who actually ate here- this is a good bowl and if you're in the mood for Pho you won't be disappointed. I'll be back!
