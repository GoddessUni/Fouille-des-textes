Brickies is good!! They make a delicious cheeseburger and potato salad here. Our server who was also the bartender (the super pretty woman with blonde hair) gave us the best service tonight when we came in for dinner. 
This is a small place inside with a few tables and some seats at the bar. From where we were sitting, I could watch the cook grill up our burgers and it was cool watching him make our food. 
They have a lot of TVs inside so no matter where you sit, you won't miss the game on, and they even had some kind of local bets based on the games. There were plenty of fans going so it was a nice temperature inside which is nice because sometimes taverns can feel a little stuffy. 
My husband and I were pleasantly surprised at this little local place. Will definitely be back if we are in the mood for a flame grilled delicious cheeseburger!
