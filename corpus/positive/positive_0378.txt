Great already... and they are still spreading their wings.

Chop 40 took this space from a pizza & burger that was good, but not compelling.  
Both the rustic, planked diniing room, and the cozy bar area got clever and subtle upgrades that improved the feel of the space.
The backyard dining area got a reboot, too, better furniture, but keeping the beautiful sky.

- but not everyone will care about vibe and furniture, let's get on to the food! - 

The menu is already solid, and slowly expanding at the same time.

I'm there for the output of the smoker:
The Chicken Bomb, smoked bacon and chicken wrapped around a hot pepper has ruined me for all other 'poppers'.

They have a smoked salmon burger like no other, I suspect they smoke the salmon first, and then reconstruct it as a patty, and grill it.

I've not seen the Chops alluded to in the places name make it to the menu yet, but I keep checking in, waiting for that happy day.
