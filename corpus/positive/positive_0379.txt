I was in town just long enough to grab lunch at Bub's.  I have wanted to try it since seeing the place on Man vs. Food, and I was not disappointed.  I decided to go with the smaller Not So Ugly Burger so I would have room for fries and a milkshake and I think it was a good choice.  The burger was very good and I probably could have finished the Big Ugly if I skipped the side dishes.  The uncooked 22oz Big Ugly displayed in the counter is the size of a dinner plate and pretty intimidating, but I may have to give it a shot the next time I have a chance.  I saw that they recently opened a location in Bloomington, so it will have to give that one a try when I visit.
