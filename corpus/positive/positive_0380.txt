I have eaten here on several occasions while living in Gulfport. Being a transplant from upstateNY, I know good Italian food. Please trust me when I tell you this is the BEST. When I say best, that's overall; food, staff, drinks and atmosphere, whether you eat indoors or out. I had my usual veal Parmesan with noodles and my husband had a vegan pasta dish. We had the lavender lemonade which is the special for part of March. The only difference I noticed this time was Pia's now charges extra for the bread. My husband and I ordered a loaf - $10.00. Whew...
We both agreed it was worth the money and our meal was delicious as usual.
