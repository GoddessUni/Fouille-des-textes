A great break from the chains - and this is coming from a daily drinker of Starbuck's.  Also, they are truly sustainability/green focused - bonus points.

I'm in St. Louis for the Summer and was recommended to go here by a friend who went to Wash U Undergrad.  The coffee is more robust and flavorful than elsewhere.  Today it is about 95 degrees outside, so they have the A/C going and the iced drinks are popular (both coffee and smoothie based).  I tried an iced coffee, which is high quality.  My gym is in Clayton and will be headed there after this, but between here and the CWE location I will definitely be back to try the entire menu of cool beverages and enjoy their WiFi and A/C this summer.  A great place to read and the house music is a mix of indy, alternative, and 80/90s rock.  The art on the wall is nice too - definitely original works not just prints.  

When trying to find it, be forewarned, it blends into the area from the outside [which I think is good] - there's free parking in the lot behind it.  Open 'til 6pm daily.
