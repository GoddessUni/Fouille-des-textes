I love the OCF Coffee House on Fairmount! I love working at cafe's, but it's rare to find one that has a good menu to sustain my stomach during study sessions. It's even rarer to find one that has a number of seating options with outlets available and a good vibe. This place offers all of that. 

The staff are incredibly friendly and knowledgeable. I've often had conversations about their coffee - and it's where I learned that lighter roast coffee has more caffeine than darker roasts. Boy was I making a mistake in ordering dark roast coffee! They bring the food directly to you and often comment how they are "happy to do so" when you give them a thank-you. 

It can be a little pricey, but honestly it's worth it to have a comfortable space to do work. They even have an early bird special if you get there early enough. The food itself is really delicious. I often order the Two Your Way - and they really do it your way! When I say over-easy, their eggs are over-easy, and their bread options are great. I like that I can order even rye bread. When I'm in a sweet mood, their french toast is a great option and their seasonal specials make it a new experience every once in a while. 

Keep up the great work, OCF Coffee House, and thanks for smiling even when I am grumbly and don't want to study.
