I've been checking this place out from Home for quite a while now, like back when it was just a food truck, so once I got to NOLA I had to try it and I was not disappointed. (Shoutout to Supa!)

I came in for some Togo food as some of my friends were back at the AirBnB. 

I ordered a couple orders of the wings which was a task within itself because of all the good flavor choices. We settled on the Wuzzam and sweet heat wings and they were both pretty bomb. They both came with an order of fries. Everything was fried to perfection and the wings were a nice size too. I also ordered another side of loaded fries, topped with cheese, bacon, jalape√±os and ranch...soo good!

The prices were reasonable. Definitely not the cheapest but not expensive either (somewhere in the middle). One thing that did blow me a little was the charging for f'ing ranch! Lol I mean it was only 50 cents a cup but it should be FREE! 

Sounds like I had a great experience right?! So why only 4 stars???

One word...RANCH! Lol

Overall solid establishment with really good wings. Whenever I'm in NOLA I'm there!
