A delicious, fast, Philadelphia cultural experience. If you're at #Construct, sneak out and try it.

I disagree with the reviewers who suggest getting the food to go: I enjoyed watching the no-nonsense staff work the lunch crowd. I had the chicken pot pie, which my server had the good sense to warn me wasn't a pie with crust, more like a stew with noodles. Came with a zingy slaw and a soft roll that was great for sopping up the gravy. The noodles were sweet and chewy, a good contrast with the slightly salty stew. 

At my buddy's behest, I saved room for shoo-fly pie. If you're not familiar with this dish, do try it sometime, though perhaps not at the expense of the apple dumpling everyone is raving about. It's a molasses pie with a crumbly top crust, served with either heavy cream or whipped cream. I didn't like the top part so much, but loved the molasses part, which reminds me of pecan pie without the pecans. I had the whipped cream, but I think the heavy cream would have gone better with the texture. I didn't dare try to steal my buddy's, though!
