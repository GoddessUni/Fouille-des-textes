I'm not a fan of Tucson.  Whenever I'm there I'm dumbfounded by the fact that so many people choose to live there.  Once I had my meal at Cafe Poca Cosa, I started to understand.  

Here's a restaurant that does a city proud.  It's gorgeous inside, slick yet comfortable.  It's menu rotates twice a day depending on ingredients.  The service is impeccable. The food is fantastic.  The drinks were fabulous.  The prices are totally reasonable.  I can find nothing to knock at this place.

The Plato Poca Cosa is a chef's choice plate with 3 entrees and highly recommended.  With food this good, let the chef decide.
