Been here a few times and the food is always amazing. This time I ordered baked tortellini with vodka sauce while my bf got penne vodka with chicken. For whatever reason, his vodka sauce was thicker and tasted better than mine even though it was supposed to be the same. On the menu it stated that it would be topped with mozzarella cheese but it was nowhere to be found on my plate. These are the reasons why I'm deducting a star because overall food was great, free bread, and fountain drinks weren't flat or watered down. If you're in the area definitely give them a try. Also, expect to wait a bit for your food, you can tell they make it fresh.
