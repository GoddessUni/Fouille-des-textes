This McDonald's has been a part of my life since circa 1979. My mother went several times a week. Happy Meals were our fuel. 

To know this McDonald's in the late seventies and eighties was to know childhood itself. I never got to have a birthday party there. But you didn't need to. The outside park was enough. One genius somehow combined height, Officer Big Mac, fitting cell bars, and a kid-powered merry-go-round to create good times. Top that off with mini chocolate chip cookies, vanilla cookies shaped like Grimace, and vanilla ice cream drenched in hot caramel, and you got utopia. 

When I was about ten, Ronald picked me to be the recipient of his balloon animal. I remember being elated. Feathered hair never bounced so high when approaching a makeshift stage. 

 I stopped eating beef In the late eighties; my bro stopped in the middish nineties. We still went for the pancakes, and even fought the status quo by asking for cheeseburgers without meat.

We walked to this McDonald's often as teens. Sometimes we were drunk. We would wish that the guys were more new wave, and the guys wished we were less stuck up. 

I am not sure if this location has a "Play Place", or as my bro infamously put it in his mid teens, a "Pway Pwace". My husband still says it in the latter way to this day. 

This past summer, we went to this location a few times. The food was always hot, and the employees were always nice. The manager is great. He was not annoyed at all when we came in late one night. He just goes with the flow. The kids that work there are fine. They are polite. 

The roof flew off in a storm in July 2019, and this McDonald's was still truckin'. Really, it was still open. That's dedication. 

When I was cleaning out a closet at my mom's this past summer, I found vintage glasses with the Hamburglar on them. I do not use them, as I want to preserve a piece of my childhood. I want to preserve happiness. Now, where's my hot fudge sundae?!
