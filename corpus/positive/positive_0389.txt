Sammy's is in an old (and frankly ugly) strip mall on Marlton pike. The inside of the restaurant is nothing to write home about either. It just looks like your basic restaurant with a tv playing one of those weird Asian game shows that I just don't understand. 

However, Sammy's scores where it counts.. The food! I got a tofu soup with beef which was awesome. It was earthy, a bit tangy, and the tofu was perfect consistency. We also got a pork dol sot and short rib BBQ. My only complaint about the food were the short ribs. They were a bit on the chewy side, but still tasted fantastic. 

There are a few things holding this place back from a five star rating. First, food was brought out on a catering cart. The cart was clearly to big to weave through the chairs and tables and the waitress had a hard time with it. Second (and this is more on the owner), the waitress clearly was overwhelmed because she was the only one serving about 40 people. Hire someone else! 

All in all Sammy's was a great experience and I can't wait to go back!
