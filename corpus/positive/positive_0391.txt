Dragon Palace was my favorite Chinese buffet! It might have needed some updates but the food an the price was great .And the main waitress Cindy was so nice an sweet made me feel like Iam family but now they closed down permanently. I didn't even know until day I went there an they had some workers there they said they are going to tear it down an build something else. I was hurt.Now I have to go to Meteraie to my second favorite East Buffet on Severn next to whole foods. It's good but the price is expensive but everything is more in that area.
