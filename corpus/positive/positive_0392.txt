This is hands down the best Vietnamese food around. It's family owned and small but the food is absolutely wonderful. We've tried several of the other Vietnamese restaurants in the Nashville area, and while the others had good food, Vinh Long has the best pho. The taste is spot on. The recipe is said to be their mom's. Since I grew up with my best friend being Vietnamese, I'm not a connoisseur but I am familiar with the taste of good Vietnamese food. I've been looking for some good pho for a long while. Kind of sad to say I only found this wonderful place about a year and a half ago. Guess I'm slow. The food is always good and consistently fresh. Hope to visit many more times.
