Found this little place tucked away on 2nd Avenue in downtown and had to go check it out. I love the concept of this place: they have crepes and waffles as the base, and you can make your own waffle/crepe with any of the toppings they offer. There's also a few crepes that have already their own toppings put together, but it seems like they don't mind if you substitute some toppings if you don't like everything on it. 

I had the Nutella Choco "Kebab" (which is what they call their crepes) which had granola, heavy whipped cream, shaved Italian chocolate, and of course plenty of Nutella. It was so  freaking  good  y'all . I went to Paris a few years ago and ate a real French crÃªpe while I was there, and I can safely say that Bartella's crepes are just as delicious... maybe even better?? I was scared it was going to be too sweet with all the chocolate, but it was actually the perfect amount! The sweet chocolate with the savory crepe mixed together perfectly to balance out the flavors. 

Whenever you're in downtown, you have to pay a visit to Bartella. This is exactly what Nashville needed and they deserve all the love and support you can give them.
