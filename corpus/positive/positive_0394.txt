WOW! The RB Burger and Sweet Potato fries are out of this WORLD. I came here for the first time for my birthday a few months ago and we stopped here on our beer tour and I was blown away. I am not even a very big burger person. We just moved to carp a month ago and have ordered take-out burgers twice already. One time I couldnt eat the whole thing and saved it in the fridge knowing I could only eat it cold the next day since we still don't have our appliances. 

I ate it for breakfast because I couldnt wait any longer and it was just as good. I can't rave enough about this place!!!! I may never leave Carp because of it. :)
