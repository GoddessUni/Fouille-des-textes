1. Definitely make a reservation if you can- we went on a weekday for lunch w/ a reservation, but there were people who walked in and were told the next available slot was 4 hours later. 

2. Really good bread that comes with this herb-y butter spread. I think I ate like 6 slices throughout the meal, heehee.

3. Amazing French onion soup, with cheese baked/melted over. Yummm!

4. Seafood salad... I didn't enjoy as much. Next time will definitely ask for dressing on the side, because there was way too much in the salad and it tasted a bit sour.

All in all 4/5, would go again!
