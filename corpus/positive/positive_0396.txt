Go with an adventurous spirit & empty stomach! You will have a lovely culinary experience! This is not your average Mediterranean restaurant. The owner & staff were all very friendly & helpful. My husband and I arrived early in the evening & had an excellent dinner tonight! We started with the Mediterranean assorted appetizers. All of the appetizers were perfect (we cleaned the plate) but we both agreed that the stuffed grape leaves were the absolute best we've ever had!! (Sometimes it's the little things that make you happy.) Moving onto the second course... I should have pulled out my phone for a photo because my beet salad was presented so beautifully... It was very artfully arranged the plate.. and piled high. And yes, it was delicious too! We chose the branzino and lamb shank for our third courses... OMG they were both mouth-watering perfections! The lamb shank fell right off the bone & was tender- the branzino was crisp on the outside, tender flesh & seasoned great! We ended our meal with a shared bite of baklava & a couple of lattes! We will go back & highly recommend them!
