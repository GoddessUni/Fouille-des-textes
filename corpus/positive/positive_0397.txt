Bambu Desserts & Drinks was founded in 2008 in San Jose, California by four Vietnamese sisters--Anh, Kelly, Jenny & Julie. Bambu has a large menu of fresh, healthy and colorful Asian-inspired Ch√®, crisp boba milk teas, bold Vietnamese espressos & blended coffees, and real & exotic fruit smoothies. It is nice to have a slightly different option from the Taiwanese bubble tea chains to change things up.

Bambu is located in the other big shopping center on Washington Ave. I write "other" as I have only been to the one shopping center higher up on Washington that contains Pho 75, Sky Cafe and the Hung Vuong Super Market. Parking didn't seem to be quite as nuts and challenging here,  but it may have been that it was later on a Sunday night. The Bambu store is clean, bright and comfortable with a limited amount of seating. They have a fairly large menu but there are several pictures on the wall describing the different drink items. My wife, who is Filippina, liked the drink options with shaved ice such as #2 Bambu Combo. This did taste similar to halo halo and it was very good. Our daughter and myself shared the Green Tea blend which was smoothie like and had a pleasant Green Tea taste. It was difficult making a decision as there were so many options.

We will definitely return to Bambu to try out some other drink options. I just hope I am as lucky with the parking. I also want to try Pho Ha which is located in the same shopping center.

4 yelp stars with potential for more.
