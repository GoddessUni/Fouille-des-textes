My wife and I popped in on opening night and were very impressed. I had the delicious pork souvlaki, which was highly recommended by an employee when I asked what dish he was most proud of. He was right! It's so tender and tasty. The fries, with a mix of hard cheese and Greek herbs and spices sprinkled on top -- outstanding. Sipping a cold glass of white and eating this in the open air seating took me right back to some special moments I've had in Greece. There were a lot of people working opening night and it was a smooth, friendly operation. One extra nice touch is that employees come around to the tables to check on seated diners. After you get your food, and if you feel like having more wine, you can order by iPad without having to go back through the line. That was fantastic, especially when it was so busy. We felt like the price points for food and wine were just right. Two great meals, plus wife ordered a feta salad to sub for fries with her octopus, and a mid-level carafe of white totaled $45. One of the owners came by and introduced herself to us and several other tables, and we had a great conversation about Greek food, traveling in Crete, etc. It's a welcoming environment. It's casual, with interesting modern urban Athens-style graffiti art on the walls and Euro hip hop music setting the right vibe as background noise. The wine, the rolled up windows, open air, the smells and kitchen sounds and noise from the Main Street traffic ... it feels like a little slice of some parts of Greece in our East Nashville neighborhood. Can't wait to go back.
