I put this on my "must do before I move to Florida" list because I'd heard many great things both locally and nationally, and the food was eclectic and well done. 

There was a 60 minute wait, which was expected on a Sunday morning, but it was strangely confusing for a first timer. I stood in a line because the assumption was that the line leading into the restaurant leads to the hostess stand or something like that, but after a few minutes I was approached by a lovely woman with a note pad who put me on the list to wait. Turns out the line was to order coffee while waiting on a table, so I ducked out and found a shady spot to wait.
Once seated, it took a reasonable amount of time to get service and some notably interesting coffee drinks, the notorious FIG was delightful and the pistachio cream was unusual in the way that something creeps up on you slowly and turns out pleasantly.
The cranberry walnut & raclette grilled cheese was unusual and offered the sweet and salty combo that I love with a slightly over duck egg on top. The Cuban viking lamb frita was delicious and slightly spicy. Overall, it was a good meal in an iconic Indianapolis spot with good friends~a well spent last Sunday in Indiana
