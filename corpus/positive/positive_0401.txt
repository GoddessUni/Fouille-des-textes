LOVE the BBQ sandwich ... and that's coming from someone who's not big on BBQ anything! It won me over first sight and again first bite. My husband and I have been there several times and not once have we been bothered by cigarette smoke. We sat in the little dining room off the bar. So grateful to have this chef making vegan comfort food, it's a nice contrast to all the boring, flavorless places that may be vegan but are lack luster to both the eyes and palette. This place is winning over the buds of herbivores and carnivores alike.
