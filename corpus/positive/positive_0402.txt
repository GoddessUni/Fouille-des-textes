My first time folks, I can't believe it - great experience! Jeff was incredible , he was patient and very accommodating. My nephew turned 26 today , he is autistic and loves his birthday. His mom, my sister is in rehab right now because she fell and we thought she wasn't going to be able to make it but she got a day pass. So one wheel chair and 4 pretty large people and a grandma and my brother in-law have 8 pm reservation - crazy stuff (Jeff took good care of us, under these circumstances. Back to the food - loved the spinach artichoke dip & meat lovers platter, and the banana foster will knock your socks off! Thanks Jeff, seriously glad we had you for the night.
