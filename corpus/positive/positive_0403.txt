I planned a small birthday party for my girlfriend here. It was great. They were able to get us a table for about 8. The place is very small, so it was nice that they could accommodate us.

They have a lot of alcohol and fancy cocktails. I think this is what they're known for. I was very sad though with the new cocktail menu because it didn't include their most delicious drink! The Cavendish. They were still able to make it for me, but that is my favourite cocktail in Edmonton. I hope that they are able to always make it.

I had to laugh because we ordered shots. This place doesn't really do shots, but they did them for us. I believe they gave my girlfriend a mixture of vanilla Chartruse and bourbon. It was awesome and probably the fanciest shot she's ever had.

Service is awesome, but slow. Thankfully the cocktails are worth it.
