What more in life do you need other than fries and pies? Aside from a cocktail in hand of course!

I'm  a fry addict and will always make room for them. So when we were inside the bar and saw someone munching on fries I immediately put on my detective hat and had to find out where they got them.

Thankfully I was told they got them in the back so I, without much work, got my group to head out and order food with me.

Whether you have the tipsy munchies or you're simply having a foodie moment, y'all need to come here. I ended up getting two orders of their hamburger fries and was not disappointed. Wasn't planning to order the second one but realized I made the mistake of sharing with my friends and couldn't have them all to myself. Every bite had a heaping amount of burger meat, cheese, lettuce, literally the works. Your tastebuds will thank you.

I need to come back and start trying the rest of their menu.
