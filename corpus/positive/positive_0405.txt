Easy to understand why they have five stars! I had the "bourbon street love" which was some amazing Mac and cheese, the best fried chicken I've ever had and some crawfish cream sauce. The chicken was a boneless thigh and I usually prefer bone in but it was juicy, crunchy even with the cream sauce on it and perfectly seasoned.  Really, really good food. No fancy ambiance, they give you your food in styrofoam and you can eat at tables outside or take it to go. I sat outside joined by two really cute kids (owners grandkids I think) and they even let me sign their truck!
