Lets get a little something out of the way first . . .this mall is about an hour outside of Philadelphia, so it peeves me somewhat that this has been dubbed the Philadelphia Outlets. . . minor grievance, pet peeve whatever.. . 

No that this is out of the way, this is a fantastic shopping destination.  It is outdoors, but the way its is designed, you almost feel like you are inside.  I like the fact that its is outdoors, especially on sunny warm afternoons.  

There is a decent array of places to get something to eat (to recharge your shopping batteries).  A Starbucks, your basic food court (that is indoors), a few Auntie Ann's sprinkled here and there and a Ruby Tuesday (i think, or something like it)

Parking is ample and even during the Christmas season I have not had any issues finding parking.  

Its clean and well kept - including the bathrooms.

And the shopping is plentiful.  From Kate Spade and Coach to Carters and Gymboree . . . Loft, Gap, Banana Republic, BeBe, Kenneth Cole, Nine West, Forever 21  . . . I could go on and on.  There are home stores as well. . . Restoration Hardware, Calphalon and more.  

Some deals are better than others.  Like any mall, the stores run sales/promos during the various holidays.  I think you can even get on their mailing list for extra coupons.  

In conclusion, its worth the battle with 76, just make sure you are well funded.
