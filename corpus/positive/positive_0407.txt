The drinks here are excellent. We spent the evening on the patio. It is big and spacious and well lit. Others have complained about Mosquitos being on the patio and they were fierce last night. We saw an attempt to control them such as citronella candles. We asked for a candle near our table and bug spray and they provided both. It didn't help much. What they need are fans, on the floor but that probably would look ridiculous and be impractical. The inside is gorgeous and cozy. Beautiful red leather banquettes and dim lighting. Go up and check out the Bullock Room. It has a full bar and is also beautifully decorated. 

Back to the drinks...the server asked us what type of drinks we were looking for. The menu is extensive. She asked, I told her and she brought me the most delicious drink, The Gin Soaked Boy. Citrusy, boozy, tart and very bright favors. My dining companion had The Penicillin. Also a very interesting drink with a smoky finish. They have a nice variety of food. We had popcorn (there are different varieties), mussels, arugula salad and a Margherita pizza. This sounds like a lot of food but these are small plates. I will definitely be back but will sit inside in the summer.
