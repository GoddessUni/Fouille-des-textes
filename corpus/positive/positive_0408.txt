I was on the fence between four and five stars, but since there are some (what I think are) unwarranted 1-star reviews, I'll try to balance it out.

I tagged along with my friend who wanted to try this place. I was born in Korea, was raised in a town with an abundance of good, cheap Asian food in California, and came to Philadelphia for college where there is a sad lack of good Korean food. 

I went before 6 when the restaurant was relatively empty and we got fast, attentive service.

For $10, I got a hearty serving of soon doo bu (soft tofu stew) and brown rice, along with the small dishes or banchan. The waiter was very attentive and checked up on us throughout the meal and someone (I think it may have been the owner) came by and kindly told my friend that people usually put kimchi on their koagies.

Compared to dining options in University City, this place rocked and I'd come again. Neither of us had the barbeque, so I can't comment on that aspect but I don't really expect all Korean barbecue places to have complete setups with fume hoods and everything...
