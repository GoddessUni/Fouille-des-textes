I am late in writing this review but my the taste of my visit here and eating akki roti( its a kind of rice flour chapati) 

The restaurant is clean and spacious. Comfortable seating and great tasting South Indian food. When we entered the restaurant it was about to close but we were accommodated as last guests. That is why I couldn't eat alot but one thing i ate stayed with me till date. 
How could i dare to forget mentioning "the great gajjar halwa" ( grated carrot desert) which is also called gajar pak, gajrela , This desert is usually cooked with milk or cream in most part of India. Here it is cooked without milk but melts like butter in your mouth. So delicious 

Brilliant. N must go place for south indian food lovers like me.
