We loved the diversity of the small plates. We had goat cheese salad, grilled shrimp, skirt steak, and scallops with chorizo, with eggplant fries on the side. My cocktail, called a Bizet, to start the evening, was divine--passion fruit pur√©e!  My fav!  All of the small plates offered up a variety of wonderful flavors in every bite. I am only giving this great little spot four stars because we received a plate of chorizo, which should have been in the scallop dish, after we had finished our meal. I would expect better from one of their restaurants. But we will return. The restaurant is small and intimate with a lovely vibe
