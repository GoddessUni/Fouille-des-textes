I come here Atleast once a month.. buck a shuck Wednesday is the best! They always have incredible new beers every time i come in. The shortrib fries are to die for! I also suggest coming in on a weekday because this place is always mobbed on the weekends! The fish tacos are great too.. any of the burgers are amazing.. all around anything you get here is delicious! Its a great atmosphere for a hang out or just a dinner with the family. The pictures on the walls of the stars and musicians gives it a nice atmosphere too! Highly recommend this place
