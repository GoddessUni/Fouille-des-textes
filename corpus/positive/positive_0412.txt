Found this restaurant by searching gluten free on grub hub. After waiting a few weeks and longingly stalking the menu, we finally went in to check it out. It was so wonderful!  When we first stepped into the restaurant we were greeted by two people behind the counter in the most friendly way, it was so lovely to be warmly welcomed!  Our orders were taken quickly and the food arrived in the same fashion. We had the chicken parm and a the pasta special, linguine dom perignon customized to be gluten free. The pasta was cooked wonderfully, the shrimp and jumbo lump crab meat were perfect and plentiful. So,so,so delicious!  The portions were big enough for two meals, we had left overs to take home.  Throughout the meal the staff made sure we had everything we needed. Overall, we are so happy to have found a restaurant with quality food (and gluten free options) and cannot wait to go back!
