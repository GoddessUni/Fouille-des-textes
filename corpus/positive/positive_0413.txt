If you love strawberries, then this is absolutely the Disney World of strawberry patches. This is a central Florida tradition, and people literally line up around the building to get the strawberry shakes and the strawberry shortcake. But there is much more to this place than that ... however, lets begin with just that. The strawberry shake was absolutely the very best strawberry milkshake that I have ever had in my life ... I mean like seriously awesome. The strawberry shortcake was good, but not the best I have ever had. I liked the strawberry shortcake, don't get me wrong, but it was simply pretty good. My partner did not like the shortcake portion, and decided that next time would probably get it without the shortcake. I thought the whipped cream was not real whipped cream, but some kind of artificial foam substance, and would not get that again either. Now, don't get me wrong, I am not dissing their whipped cream, but I am an absolute snob when it comes to whipped cream -- I prefer the real stuff, made from real cream and really whipped into whipped cream ... this lets out all of those things in cans, and plastic tubs you may have seen in stores. So, given my partner's proclivities, we are left with a rather awesome option: just the berries with Ice Cream on top ... you see, they have lots  of options. Now, after this section, they have the fruit section where you can by Berries by the flat (currently a two flat limit per customer because it is early in the season). They also have lots of other Florida produce and stuff shipped in from South America as well. They have an awesome picnic table area that is both shielded from rain as well as too much sun, and it is way cool, relaxing and just a neat place to hang out, sip strawberry milkshakes, and eat berries and cream. We will be back soon, and do just that very thing.
