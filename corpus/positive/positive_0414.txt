If you are looking for a unique place to dine in Tampa, check out the newly restored Floridan Palace right in downtown. The hotel opened in July after being closed for 30 years. It has been beautifully redone and you feel like you are walking back in time. Our dining experience was superb in every way. Todd, our server, was a family friendly server for our party of 10 including 4 children. The menu has an excellent selection of entrees, and they were served as described. We were adventurous in choosing some of the less familiar dishes and were not disappointed. The kids had no problem consuming their meal. The desserts were to die for. Prices are a tad above average, but well worth the money. We were not hurried during our dining experience and needs were attended to in a timely manner. We will be returning with more of our family and friends.
