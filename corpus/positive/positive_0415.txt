I hosted a baby shower here in July 28, 2019. They were so pleasant to work with. I talked to two different managers before the shower, the first one I asked a lot of questions, the second time I called to confirm everything, both were so helpful and nice. The day we got there, the manager came in introduced himself, the server was Jazlin, she was so kind and attentive. The food was amazing. They have the best wings hands down. I highly recommend this place for any type of party. I was so pleased with everything. Thank you Frailey's for making our experience wonderful.
