I had a great experience during my first time at Four Day Ray. This is a cool space with indoor and outdoor seating. We intially intended to go for just a beer or two, but ultimately got hungry and decided to split a snack. We decided on the pepperoni, sausage, and sweet pepper flatbread, and this was a great decision. The flatbread was actually a true flatbread - not just subbing in a thinner crust pizza and calling it a day. The crust had a nice crunch, but the toppings were flavorful and the stars of the show. I have to call out the sauce in particular; this was incredible pizza sauce that had a nice sweetness to it that complemented the meats and peppers. We both enjoyed our beers as well. 

We dined in-house during a time where Indianapolis and its suburbs were starting to reopen, and I appreciate the measures FDR took to make us feel comfortable. They had all servers wearing masks, and they had a system with a little card on a table that allowed you to flip to one side when you needed service and the other side for when you didn't. I don't know if this was more to keep servers or guests at ease, but either way it minimized unnecessary interactions up close. 

The beer was good and the flatbread was great, so I will be back to FDR in the future.
