Was so excited to try this with my girlfriend! Very fun & modern aesthetic/vibe to the place. We went on a Thursday evening during their soft opening and it was somewhat busy but not packed. Service was slow...we were there for probably an hour and a half / almost two hours in total. Our waitress seemed very distracted training another employee but then she was also just kind of standing behind the bar so I was confused. We didn't place our order until sitting for probably 45minutes. Which isn't a big deal since I was with a friend and we were enjoying our time but still something they should work out probably.

Redemption season....Food was excellent. Lobster Tots were delish. Picture a fried Mac and cheese ball but a crab cake (lobster) filling. With their 'awesome sauce'. They were indeed awesome 

I don't do oysters but my friend had 3 different types, both from west coast and east coast and she enjoyed them all. We also had the Lobster Press and lobster Mac and cheese, and salads and it was bomb!! Will be back for sure, hoping they can smooth out the service kinks!!
