When here since I had spent the entire day in the car and this restaurant was right next to my hotel and I could walk here. I just couldn't bear getting back into the car to drive anywhere on this rainy foggy night. Ordered house salad, chicken Marsala and beer. Salad was very impressive and came out very fast with a loaf of brown bread. Not your typical afterthought side salad. Beer was ice cold and arrived quickly as well. Chicken Marsala was also very good with a healthy portion of two pounded chicken breasts, a ton of mushrooms and a great sauce. Steamed broccoli side was perfectly cooked.  

Maybe I hit it on a good night, but I was satisfied with service and food and would venture down here again.
