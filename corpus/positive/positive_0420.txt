We've come to Nomad pizza several times now and each visit always has consistently good food and great service! The wait staff is always upbeat and efficient- we are always quickly seated and served within minutes upon arrival.
We regularly stop by after our DS's pediatrician appointments across the street, for the happy hour specials, which offer $5 wine, beer and 7' inch pizza as opposed to their regular 14' inch.  The restaurant can
We came here on Friday and this place was hopping, I was so glad to see other families out enjoying dinner and drinks with their little ones in a nice establishment.  There were plenty of highchairs to go around,  which is key these days.  We pretty much ordered one of every special on the menu, the pies came out at a great pace and our server did a great job of keeping our drinks topped off. 
We had two friends, who were Nomad newbies, come along and they just raved over the pizza. 
It is a great slightly charred, thin and crispy crust pizza. 
My favorite is the arugula prosciutto pizza. The bitter greens compliment the salty charcuterie! I always order one when I got there. The space is a nice size and you don't feel like you are on top of the next table.  There is a nice little bar if you want to grab a drink by the door and in the back, there is the open brick oven pizza where you can see all the ingredients and love that go into each individual pie. It really has a warm and inviting vibe! DS loved the margarita and marinara pie. The group favorite was the sopressata pizza. They were all simply prepared but oh so wonderful.
The medallions of chocolate was a highlight for my 19 month old chocolate monster. I did get a little taste and can say that it was delicious, unfortunately for the other patrons at my table, his grabby hands didn't allow them the same luxury!
