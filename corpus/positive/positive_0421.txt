Great atmosphere and concept.  

I was there as a member of a birthday party on a Saturday night.  We had a reserved booth with one of the gaming consoles.  The one we had was capable of playing SEGA Genesis, NES, and SNES games.  You can get a bucket of different games by letting them hold your ID until the games are turned back in.  The rest of the video arcade games are all free, so no need to bring your quarters!

Food wise, being a vegetarian I had the veatloaf which was very tasty!  One of the best I've had outside of a vegetarian/vegan restaurant.  I also ordered some of the fried pickles.  They were good but a little too salty.  

Overall the service we experienced was great!  My only complaint and this is a minor one, as the night went on the music got louder.  Almost too loud.  I would definitely go back though!
