Now, Pietro's has your classic Italian feel with great ambience and even better service. Their waitstaff was Johnny-on-the-spot and could answer any menu questions and help point you in the right direction. Most importantly, let's talk about their food. We had a large party and decided to dive in family-style, ordering pizza, spaghetti, ravioli, and salad. Every dish (except the salad of course) came out HOT from the kitchen made from scratch and were to die for. There were multiple times that I looked up from eating and it seems everyone else had given up and reached their maximum capacity, but I kept on eating because let me tell you, it was awesome. Next time I'm in Philly, you better believe I'll be back in here for some ravioli and pizza.  Highly recommend!
