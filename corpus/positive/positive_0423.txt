This was a fantastic yelp find! We walked from the Wyndham Grand. Not a bad walk, and there are stores along the way. We were seated right away. We each ordered coffee. I ordered the banana foster pancake which was amazing and the crab cake Benedict,  with a side of grits. I was only in town for two nights so I had to have as much good food as possible! The crab cakes were very good sized and they were loaded with the perfect amount of crab and breading. My friend hand the ranchero omelet with city grits. City grits are grits with bacon, Gouda, and green onion crumple. Our bill was under 40, which may be pricey for breakfast, but it was well worth it and we didn't need lunch.
