First time here today.  We wanted to try something different and southern-style fast food seemed interesting enough so we gave it a shot. I loved the Okra!!  I like my okra raw, broiled, but this was a yummy (but unhealthy) treat since its fried lol.  We got it as side dish to the alligator meat basket (which the hubby enjoyed, by the way).  Service was great despite being more of a drive-thru place.  There's ample seating for guests and being that Reno has nice weather at this time, it made for a delightful lunch experience.  

Will definitely come back and try other menu items.  A dine-in guest who came in while we were eating highly recommended getting the fish basket so that is definitely going to be on our list next time.
