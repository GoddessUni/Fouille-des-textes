Amazing local, organic food. Great service. The whole menu is labeled so if you have any special diet needs, this is the place! Tons of GF options. When I told Jordan, our server, that I was GF, he very thoughtfully brought rice crackers for olive oil dipping. Very, very few restaurants do that. The "popcorn shrimp" was amazing, the mediterranean stuffed chicken delicious, and the vegan chocolate cake was very good. (I have to say that this dessert was the only misfire... the cake was a little chewy and I didn't care for the "cream" which tasted like solid oil, but the ice cream, berries, and sauce totally saved it.) Will definitely return again. We came two years ago and were so glad we came back.
