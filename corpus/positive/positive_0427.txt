A new nano brewery in a really cool space.  The husband loved his cranberry ale and said it was the most drinkable one he has had. I had a flight, then asked them to mix me a pint of the cranberry and pumpkin pie ale. It was delicious! I enjoyed talking with the owner (and brewer) about some of the future batches and styles of beer he plans on making- such as a chocolate peppermint stout. Right now this is a small brewery with about 8 beers on tap.  While the tasting room is quite large it didn't feel cavernous, rather it was very cozy. I wish them success and look forward to a return visit.
