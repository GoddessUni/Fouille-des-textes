Went here on a Friday evening. Service was fantastic. We ate inside, although they have a surprisingly large space on the sidewalk that has a great atmosphere - flowers and heaters. Maybe next time. Love the look of the inside of the restaurant. Not too loud, even though it got very crowded as the evening went on.

Had a delicious Pera martini. Did not care for my appetizer of arancini. The risotto was really undercooked. Had the scallops for dinner and they were large and perfectly cooked. For dessert had ice cream with an espresso shot and mini cannoli. Fantastic.

Would definitely go again. Great experience. Lots of other foods on the menu that looked equally delicious.
