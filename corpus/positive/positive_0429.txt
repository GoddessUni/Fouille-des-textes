First of all the food that I had was fantastic. Well thought out, properly prepared and presented and really tasted great. A couple of things I thought could have been better. The bar is too cramped and boxed in. Didn't feel as comfortable as I would have liked, but we love to sit at the bar, so that may not affect everyone. The space is beautiful and they have sound panels installed near the ceiling so I'm sure that helps with the reflective sound control and I think that's something many restaurants skimp on so good job there. We started with the tuna appetizer and it is one of the best appetizers I have had anywhere. The issue was the price and the portion didn't line up. I know sashimi grade tuna is expensive and very perishable, but that serving was microscopic. It was expensive and it should have had 25% more tuna or cost 25% less in my opinion. I had the shrimp lunch entree and it was also great and I thought the portion size was appropriate. My wife had the ricotta gnudi and it was also great. We had one glass of wine each and while it was a great lunch, it was too expensive for us to become regular dining patrons. That being said, we will be back and our server Quent did a great job taking care of us and informing us on the menu. My suggestion would be to expand the beer selections and offer some less expensive wine alternatives. I will say that I think the quality of the food and the presentation was outstanding and the space looks great.
