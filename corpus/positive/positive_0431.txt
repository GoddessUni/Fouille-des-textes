As someone who grew in a big Italian family, I'm very picky when it comes to Italian food! I've been to Oggi a handful of times and have taken many friends and family here and everyone always loves it! They actually do open table, even during peak dinner times which makes it super convenient to plan ahead for a Friday or Saturday night dinner! I love the chicken parm and used to order that almost all the time but the last time I went I had the Pistachio Chicken and it was incredible! The only thing I wish they would start carrying is calamari as an appetizer. Overall a solid place to come to for Italian food!  

Also, parking on the island can be tricky but they do have a parking lot in the back!
