Very friendly staff and seriously delicious food.  The vibe of the restaurant is impressive.  You walk down the stairs into a cozy, classy, casual room filled with amazing aromas.  A fun open kitchen with a brick pizza oven allows you to watch the chefs in action.  A large bar with TVs is perfect for the single diner (such as myself), but lots of room for couples and groups as well.  The FOOD IS OUTSTANDING.  I can't even begin to recommend one item over another - just go with an open mind and an empty stomach.  I will say that the finishing touches (such as the fancy crunchy salt bits in the caprese salad) are what put this place over the top.
