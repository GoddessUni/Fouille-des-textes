We came here to get my SIL some comfort food after she spent 6 years in the Philippines. The menu is on a chalkboard by the door because it changes regularly. We had the most lovey service, my SIL talked to everyone in Tagalog and ordered for us. We tried the vegetable lumpiah, chicken adobe, pork adobe, pancit, and one of the soups. I wish I had thought to take pictures! We ate it family style and had were totally stuffed but had tons of leftovers! My SIL had not eaten that much in the year she has been back in America, she loved it, and it was very comforting, like a taste of home. I had never tried Filipino food before, and also really enjoyed it. The lumpiah, pork adobe, and pancit were the stars for me, they were all so tasty! 

My family said the inside felt exactly like it would in the Philippines with a small Asian market and and Pacquiao fights playing on the TV. 

The Chef was such a delight and came out and chatted with us, and gave us all a complimentary flan which was also reallly yummy. Chef Chris worked with Paul Prudhomme for 18 years so he really knows what he is doing in the kitchen. 

Overall a very nice relaxing lunch with delicious food and excellent service. We will definitely be back.
