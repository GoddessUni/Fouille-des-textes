Went here for lunch a few days ago, really enjoyed it. I'm used to this kinda food eat it pretty often but this was different. Had the spicy chicken kabob wrap with a variety of toppings and it was quite filling and held me over until a late dinner. 

Line was a bit long, but that was also because it was during a lunch time rush. Beyond that though the service was quick and easy.

Only reason why i didn't give it a 5/5....i asked for a regular coke and got diet, but probably just a simple mistake not a big deal I should be drinking diet anyway. -_-. Will definitely return on upcoming trips to Philadelphia.
