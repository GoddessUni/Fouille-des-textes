Quaint little Vietnamese spot tucked away in a hidden corner. Ordered Pho Tai and  Bun Bo Hue (Lemongrass Beef Noodle Soup) and both were delicious!!! The Pho had that deep bone broth taste that should be expected in authentic Pho. The Bun Bo Hue especially delicious, not overly pungent so that it tickles the back of your throat to makes u cough but strong enough to taste the spices and fresh citrus flavor. The noodles they used were the proper noodles for this soup and cooked perfectly al dente! It's hard to find a WELL MADE Lemongrass soup,....trust me, I've been looking!! Definitely stop in and give this hidden  gem a try!
