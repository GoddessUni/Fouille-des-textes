Love this place! Great salmon, home made fish spread, warm german potato salad and an ice cold Miller high life on tap served in an ice cold mug! My 88yr old mom loves the burger and a frozen mug beer:) Food is consistently good, outdoor picnick table seating, Indoor fireplace in the winter. Wait staff is friendly. I don't rate places that i don't like at all, if i love it, i rate it... i do love this place but i have one complaint...twice my moms service dog has been turned away. Its very easy to set aside a couple of tables on the perimeter for such seating. We would have eaten there every week but because of this we go somewhere else.
