My first instinct upon trying my first doughnut from DoughBoys was that I wouldn't give them more than three stars.  I don't like paying more for an otherwise cheap item simply because they dress it up like something fancy.  This is why I never liked Krispy Kreme.  But then I had a drink of my coffee and fell in love.  They REALLY know how to brew a fantastic cup of coffee here!  Almost makes it worth the trip to the south end of town!

Other than that, though, the doughnuts were, well, just doughnuts.  My favorite was the Buttermilk Crumb.  If going somewhere with bells and whistles and fancy TVs and music and cute girls behind the counter makes you feel better about your doughnuts, then this is the place for you.  As for me, I like my doughnuts cheap and kind of ghetto.
