i've been here many times and each time I thoroughly enjoyed myself. I've only ever gone with friends and we're mostly chocoholics. :) Their drinks are generally good (the mint chocolate martini and the tiramisu martini, one of their drink specials are my favorites) and their sweets are amazing. 

when you are seated, the waiter/waitress gives you some water (they don't always have ice water, which is fine but less than ideal) and a plate full of mini-cookies -- one for each person at the table. I like how that's what they provide and not bread or something non theme fitting.

this is a chocolate bar, so i go there for the desserts. their desserts are really good. I really like their sorbets. I also love how they have a banana BREAD split and not just banana splits. However, the way they caramelize their bananas is just heavenly -- the bananas are still firm but have a nice crispness from the caramelizing. they have a caramel latte cheesecake that I had tonight and it was really good. we also got the banana split sorbet and a gingerbread cake. everything was fantastic. 

the staff is great there. helpful, friendly, and don't over. :) the greeter tonight had a nice sense of humor.

my one complaint is the fairly tight seating and small tables. we almost bumped elbows with neighboring tables tonight. things were better after shifting the table a bit, but still slightly tight. i needed to shift my chair a few times to let people through. the table has flowers, candle, and all our food stuff. when the food came out, we ended up moving some things to the corner and onto the floor to fit the food. i guess part of it was because we were all sharing, but a bit more table space  would've been better. on the bright side, it does create a cozy atmosphere. :) 

all in all, this is a pretty great place.
