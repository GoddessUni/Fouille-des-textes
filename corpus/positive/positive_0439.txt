After reading about this place in the star, liking beer, liking bourbon... seemed like a place I can't lose. 

The self tapping part is pretty cool! The bartender gives a card with 32 oz, and essentially you chose which beers you try, and how much you try of said beer. Caleb was great about explaining how it works. Once you've slogged through 32oz, the bartender just resets the card. 

Sure, if you are looking to shotgun pints uninterrupted, you may not be a fan of the 32oz rule. It worked perfectly for me as I was getting 4-6oz per pour to get my sample on. 

They also have (had?) Booker's Rye whiskey, which I don't recall seeing much. Add in some jeffersons and a whole lot more.... I can see myself getting lost in here. 

Speaking of bourbon; they also do a smaller pour if you are looking to sample before diving in. 

The decor is nice, patrons were pleasant... a unique place worth checking out. I didn't eat, but the food I saw going by looked worth devouring.
