I had the breakfast burrito and it's the best breakfast burrito I've had in St. Louis so far. It was scrambled eggs and Chorizo inside a tortilla with a medium hot salsa across the top. There was a side of beans and the whole thing was smothered with a generous amount of cheddar cheese and then baked. On the sides were a large pile of olives on one side and jalapenos on the other. I prefer things on the spicy side and I didn't feel the need to use the jalapenos to keep the spice level up. The salsa and Chorizo did fine on their own. My wife had the eggs benedict. I'm not a hollandaise fan myself so I didn't try the dish but my wife said that it was the best cooked benedict she had in her life. The eggs were perfect in her estimation. I did try some of her potatoes and they were heavenly. 

The coffee was good, not great but all the servers take turns taking the pot around the whole dining room so if you like a constantly warmed up cup their system is perfect. 

I went at 7:30 in the morning on a Saturday and parking was easy to find and the crowd was light. By the time I left the booths were almost all full and there was a lively crowd forming.
