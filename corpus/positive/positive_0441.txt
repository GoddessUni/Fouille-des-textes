More of a fan of the operation in general than the actual wine, but as a newer winery this spot certainly has potential and I look forward to sampling selections I missed on this visit. 

I enjoyed the few reds I tried, and one of the 2 Vidal Blancs. Beer lovers should try their white wine that was made with hops. Very different and tasty, but I'd have to be inspired as to what it would pair with best. I didn't taste any of their sweet offerings yet, but a few sounded interesting.

The tasting room is of a medium size and along with the bar has about 12 of more tables of varying sizes. Music seems to be a given here, today was a solo singer/guitarist who I am truly sorry I did not get a name on. Probably the best musical act I've ever encountered in this type of establishment. Everyone in the room was grooving to his 70's songbook selections. There was plenty of family help taking care of tastings and food. They allow you to bring your own but also have some very good a reasonable cheese options to purchase there. There is also an outside patio area overlooking some of the vines. Tastings are $8 for 5 pours( fair size ones) and glasses were around $5. Definitely better than some other NJ wineries I've been to, and I will try to check back as new varieties are released.
