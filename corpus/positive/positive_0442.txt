Tria in 3 words:  smart, classy, relaxed.

Smart:  Whoever plans their beer, wine, and cheese lists really knows their stuff, including old favorites and lesser-known delights.  The staff are also extremely knowledgeable about all things beer/ wine/ cheese.

Classy:  This is not a pub where you pound pints with your frat brothers.  The focus is on enjoying the food, drink, and conversation.

Relaxed:  The staff are always welcoming and helpful.  Even if the wait is like an hour, they find a polite way to break the news.  They're there when you need something, and will happily explain the virtues of Tria's fine fermented products if you ask, and yet they're discrete enough to allow you to linger over that last sip or bite, even if the place is crowded.
