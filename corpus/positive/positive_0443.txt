Ron has been working on my guitars for years and has always provided top notch service. Recently he took my so so playing American Strat and turned it into a dream fixing the set up and installing new pickups that met my specifications.  AWESOME JOB!  I trust no one else with my guitars.  He provides honest and quick service that is top notch.  He even gave one guitar that I was considering buying the once over and told me that it was a no go.... he would not take a cent for that.  This is the place if you want real guitar service.
