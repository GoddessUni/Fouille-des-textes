A very busy pizza shop and the pizzas looked amazing.  Michael Myers etched into the window and a picture of Ice-T indicating which is the ice tea dispenser, very endearing.  The Cheesesteak was pretty much a standard pizza shop cheesesteak, maybe a touch better. I did like that the mushroom spent time on the grill so they weren't your typical pizza shop mushrooms on a cheesesteak.  Everyone including the customers were very polite.  I ate this Cheesesteak with Rich Shane of the Fermented Adventure while recording a Fermented Adventure podcast episode at Philadelphia Brewing Company.  I do enjoy eating my cheesesteaks at the Philadelphia Brewing Company.  I did not love the $10.50 cheesesteak price tag.  Good/very good overall experience.
