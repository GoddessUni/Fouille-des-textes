I was intrigued with chatter on this place. I've frequented this establishment under different names/management, like Legal Beagle and Murphy's Law. I'm glad they were able to literally ReBar this into something that was more "with the times" rather than just the attorney/courthouse smoke hangout. The food and vibe were completely different. An item I wanted to try was no longer on the menu so I ordered the Rebar Grilled Cheese. It took a little while for our food to come out but when it did it looked and smelled.  Buttt....my sandwich was cold. Ironically not all over, just in the middle. Like when you cook a grilled cheese but you don't allow the middle to get hot...or you add chilled ingredients to the middle, yea that.  I really wanted to love it... but the whipped chèvre (goat cheese) killed the rest of it for me. Don't get me wrong, I am a fan of goat cheese but in this instance it was way too overpowering to be matched with all of the other ingredients. I would have appreciated a better cheddar cheese but again, my tongue was covered in chèvre. Next time I'll order it on the side because I was literally scraping it off. The fries were pretty good and the array of condiments they give you were nice to have. I could definitely come here  and just order fries with the house sauce + an adult shake and be fine! Looking forward to trying the rest of the menu when I can get down to the area.
