Sagami is still the best in the metro Philadelphia area, it's a true Japanese Sushi Restaurant so don't even think about asking for cream cheese on your salmon roll!    However, this is one of the few Sushi restaurants that uses real king crab in their California rolls.

Great, fresh Sashimi, excellent salads and appetizers, and an excellent Japanese kitchen serving some of the best cooked Japanese such as Udon, Soba, Sukiyaki or Teriyaki, and probably the best Tempura around!    The Negimaki (Steak & Scallion) is superb and the best I have ever had.   So even if you don't eat Sushi - you will have an outstanding traditional meal unmatched by any other Japanese restaurant in the South Jersey/Phila. region. 

We went there recently with some vegan friends and they have many menu items to satisfy even the most picky non-carnivores.  

A few cold appetizers are particularly appealing; try the side-dish clear noodle salad, or the Asparagus with Sesame sauce.    

Sure, it's crowded and feels a little cramped.   But this adds to the authenticity and the atmosphere is very cozy with a great staff that is extremely attentive.
