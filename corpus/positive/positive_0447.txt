This was my second time at Milkboy, and couldn't have been more different than the last.

The service tonight was great, our waitress was extremely knowledgeable of the beer and cocktails, as well as the food menu.

The issue this evening is that they have hired a new chef and are in the process of changing the menu for the summer.  This lead to multiple trips back to our table for our waitress to let us know that we could not actually get what we ordered.

In the end we got the dry rubbed chicken wings, steak tacos (which they made Korean style with kimchi since they couldn't make the Korean sandwich or BBQ pork tacos) and a dry-rubbed burger with Tasso ham.  The burger was served with bacon instead of the Tasso ham, which was instantly noticeable- but neither our waitress or our table was informed of he substitution.

The flavor and portion size of the tacos were both great, and the burger was cooked perfectly, just not up to expectations set by the menu description.

If you are a bourbon fan, absolutely get the Bourbon Chai cocktail, served in a mason jar and just strong enough to make you happy you chose that over your standard old fashioned.

I would definitely come back again, but I'll wait until after they're out of this transition stage.
