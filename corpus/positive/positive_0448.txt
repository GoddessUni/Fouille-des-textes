I've been wanting to try this place for a while now and I'm so glad I did. Don't be fooled by the outside appearance this place is the real deal for Dim Sum. I also got the scallion cakes which were heaven! The dim sum is amazing and the pork they use is fresh. You can watch the two ladies make everything from scratch in the open kitchen area. The food is good, flavorful, and very fresh. The service was good too. The dishes are large enough to share for two. I can't wait to go back. 

This place does take credit card but its a $20 minimum.
