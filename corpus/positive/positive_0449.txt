Hands down my all time favorite sushi spot. I don't go often, but every single time I do I receive the same level of excellent quality and hospitality from the staff. Hearing that someone "found a maggot" is concerning, but I find it hard to believe considering how clean the establishment is when I go and how often I see waitstaff cleaning. I was recommended by a friend and I've been hooked ever since and every time I take someone they are also hooked as well. Go to the restaurant and see for yourself! While you are there, order the Fire Island roll (you're welcome).
