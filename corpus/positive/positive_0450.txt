I came to this place 2 weeks ago for some dinner. I've heard amazing things about this. It's located in Santa Barbara, California. It's an very popular restaurant and bar with great food. I've heard great things about Lure Fish House. Originally, I was gonna eat here almost an year ago, but my plan was cut short. Had to wait 'til this visit.

Food:
I got the New England Clam Chowder soup and Lobster Ravioli for dinner. First off, Clam Chowder... Presentation was nice. It was very creamy and delightful. Heavenly good. It's my kind of soup. Excellent pick I've made. Now for the lobster ravioli. Comes with 2 pieces of bread. Really amazing. Ravioli was very good. Lobster inside the ravioli was on point. I really love the cream sauce. It's an perfect combination. It was so worth eating. 

Service:
My experience I had with the waiter was amazing. Never had any problems with the service here so far. 

Other stuff:
They do have happy hour at the certain which I didn't get an chance to look at it. It's something I would enjoy on an weekly basis. If I was living in Santa Barbara or Goleta, I would go here twice an week, just for some happy hour. But I live over 2 hours away from here. It's an no go. But will go here again, if I ever come back to SB.

Overall, excellent experience I got here. It was worth waiting for, and was my last stop before heading back home. Will be back soon.
