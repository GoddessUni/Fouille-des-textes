I have trouble considering Ruby's a diner. While the atmosphere is definitely that of a fifties diner, the food is above others I've been to, but the hours are much shorter.

The atmosphere: They've got a little train going around the ceiling, milkshakes galore, waitresses in striped dresses who offer cherry Cokes... etc. The basic fifties diner stuff.

The food: Great! I believe this is the place that turned me into a honey mustard convert. It's also one of the few places away from the beach I've found that serves up a good fish taco. The milkshakes, of course, are bangin, as are the chicken strips and burgers. Love the swiss guacamole burger especially.

The hours: My favorite thing about diners is that they usually are open 24-7 or at least very late. However, Ruby's is a chain and don't have diner hours at all. So whenever I'm craving diner food Ruby's is closed.

Basically, I'd say if you were in the area and had some extra crash and want some good food hit up Ruby's. If it's around dinner time and you're not in the area there's probably better places to go... but if you want a diner-esque experience then, again, hit up Ruby's.
