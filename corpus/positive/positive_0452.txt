My favorite sushi joint in Boise bar none. I have to get the AYCE bc it's just too hard to choose one or two things and impossible to stop. They also include appetizers as a part of the meal. There is also quite a wide variety of choices.

I always have to start with that seared Ahi salad because it is so amazing! It is a little spicy so if you don't like spicy please know that. Their jalapeno poppers are to die for as well. And I love tempura any way I can get it, and they do it so well. They just do everything so well.

As far as rolls go my favorites are the Ichiban Crystal crunch, and cherry blossom. But there are so many really really spectacular rolls here. The place is clean, it is a little small and I wish they had a location closer to the west side so that the rest of us don't have to drive quite so far to come visit. 26 bucks for the dinner price isn't bad really when you consider how much Sushi some of us can eat lol.
