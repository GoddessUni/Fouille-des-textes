This place was delicious! We had the roasted cauliflower appetizer as recommended, it was as good as all the other reviews say. My husband had what he called "a really good old fashioned" and he has very high standards for old fashioneds. I had a great little cocktail called "The Rosemary", this was really yummy- I love rosemary. 
For the entrees my husband had the "From the Sea" special which was swordfish with some delicious lite quinoa fitter things that I tasted. I had the "Rutabaga La Plancha"- this is the only vegetarian item on the menu- and it did not disappoint! I would order this again and again!
Also the dinning room is very nicely designed.
Our waitress was very good at her job and was Johnny-on-the-spot about everything. Also she was super friendly.
Yes this is a fancier/pricier place but if you're going to have one expensive meal in Nashville I would make it Etch. The portions were actually really large for a fancy restaurant! We both arrived starving and it was hard to finish our entrees, we were stuffed. I really wanted to try their dessert but I was too full.
