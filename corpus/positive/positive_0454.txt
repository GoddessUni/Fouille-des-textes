We tried to make a reservation on Saturday, but they said the only opening was 5:30pm, we could not make it from Los Olivos in time for the reservation so we had to pass, when we got back to Santa Barbara, we stopped in on the chance that we could be seated, and I'm so glad we tried.  We were seated immediately outdoors, which was our preference.

It was our first time, so we asked the waiter to recommend some of his favorites and ended up ordering several to share: guacamole, seafood empanada's (our favorite, we got 3 orders of this).  The whitefish skewers on purple mash, the shortrib sopes, the cochinita pibil, zucchini flower quesadilla (just ok in comparison to the other dishes) and many wonderful margarita's. The standout items for me were the seafood dishes, but I highly recommend anything here, we were all very happy with our meals.

I was not expecting to like this place, but I absolutely loved it, and I'm so glad that my party insisted on trying it.  I will definitely visit again next time I'm in Santa Barbara.
