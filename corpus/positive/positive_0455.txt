My husband and I enjoyed two amazingly delicious dinners at Tony and Nello's. Having lived for 3 years in Naples, Italy, I was so excited to taste great, real-Italian food, here in St. Petersburg. Husband and I couldn't stop ooohing and aweing :-). Each meal is actually 2-4 meals, so plan to relive your Great Meal Experience, several more times, at home. Truthfully and happily, I know where the majority of my VERY BEST meals will originate, from now on, and it will not be from my kitchen. Beyond the food, Tony and Nello are very kind and gracious hosts, as was our thoughtful and cheerful server, Christine; you can see their enjoyment in delighting their very happy diners!!! Looking forward to our next meals there, very, very soon.
