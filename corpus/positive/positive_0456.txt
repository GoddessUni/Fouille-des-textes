Saturday. 10pm. "I'm off to get some tacos" dammit (bum lazy defiance of fending for myself without having to cook, instead fetch some meat in a tortilla somewhere off the street). 

And street indeed. "Street food" should be a category. These are legit Mexican street tacos. Just like I found in Mexico City, San Diego & LA. 

Taqueria 5 Amigos is a trailer parked outside El Bohemio night club. I've only seen it parked there at night on the weekends (hence, how I knew where to go on a late Saturday night). (And it was raining so I didn't pull out my camera phone to show you just how rad this spot is -- you'll have to go yourself!)

They cover every nook of possible orders in this cart run by two guys. From horchata to nachos to 'dillas to burritos to tacos of all types, if you leave displeased it's because you went to the wrong place. 

Street food is for those that soak up what's genuine and authentic about cities, and our fair city has more stellar street food than you'd imagine. 

There's nowhere I'd rather be than on a dreary Saturday night than leaning on a pole, amongst scattered men waiting for their order, in front of a grill street side. 

Beware of parking in the El Bohemio lot. You'll get parked in if you're timing's right (probably any time during the weekend) and won't be able to leave unless you adventure into El Bohemio to find the driver of the car parked behind you, or get lucky like me and the car's driver is asleep in the car waiting for his friend to come back out of El Bohemio. 

$ 4 burritos. $1.50 tacos (and my cabeza taco was on the "super taco" end of size). Speaking of cabeza (that's head)... it was brilliant. Stewed. Smooth. Crazy rich flavor that gives you an immediate beef high. Tack on the "hot" tomatillo salsa, and score one for the gipper (that's you).
