I can't speak for the food at this place yet, but it all looks and smells so good. I know that they serve breakfast and lunch there. The prices are very competitive to other places serving similar type of food.

I can tell you that their coffee is SO much better than Starbucks and at a much better cost for what you get. Even something as simple as an Americano is so much better than those other chain coffee places where the coffee tastes like it was made hours ahead of time.

Coffee is not the only type of drink that they serve/make here either. There is a variety of teas, hot chocolate, etc.
