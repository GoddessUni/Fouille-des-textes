Great beer offerings. Cool place you can hang and drink some beer or they also have beer for purchase or brewing supplies. Located into Brandon, the staff was friendly, very cool tasting room. Our beertender let us try several things before making our decision. They have special events as well which they post on Facebook. Live music, open mic, trivia. 
I had the Ice Cream Sammich- Milk Stout: Loaded with bitter dark malts and a signature malt backbone and judicious caramel malts at 8.2% ABV. It was a delicious beer, great flavor. Cool place in Brandon for beer, impressed with the products they are putting out.
