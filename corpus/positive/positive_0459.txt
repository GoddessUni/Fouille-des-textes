Me and my husband had never been before. I didn't know what to expect as I like to surprise myself and not look ahead at the menu and let me tell you guys, that was the worst decision! The options all looked and sounded amazing I didn't think I'd ever come up with a final decision. Me and my husband had a great time there. The food was amazing and the atmosphere was romantic and relaxed. Our server Ray was so sweet and gave us great recommendations and I found a new favorite mocktail because of her. We will definitely be going back for our anniversary or a holiday dinner with the family.
