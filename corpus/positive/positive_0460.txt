I JUST moved here and all the shopkeepers at Marketplace have been so nice to us, telling us where to go for this and that.  The free beer tasting night was fun, we will go back next time around.  The selection of produce, pasta, baked goods, etc etc is pretty good and enough for me to re-evaluate where I do my grocery shopping, since it's just down the block and I'd rather support a local establishment than drive up to the supermarket.  As for the "lonely" aspect- sure, but it's nice feeling like you can wander around, and the more we spread the word the better the place will feel. I hope it does well- tons of potential.
