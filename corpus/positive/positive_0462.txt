Bern's completely and fully redeemed themselves from the Bern's I used to know. We called at 7pm on a Tuesday night for reservations and they told us 7:15pm, so we rolled up, valeted the car, and were on our epicurean journey. 

Kurt S was our waiter. Gold tie. Stellar service. He was a great server and anticipated our needs throughout dinner. 

I ordered a glass of the Francois Vouvray dry white wine. Around $11/glass and well worth it. It was very smooth and perfect for my pre-meal drink.

I normally order a steak, but seeing how I just ate at Charley's 3 days prior, I opted for their rack of lamb. Fabulous choice. Grilled medium rare and served with the typical accompaniments of a baked potato, fresh haricot verts, fried onion hoops, and chopped carrots. 

The hubby ordered the surf and turf special; a filet grilled perfectly medium rare, and lobster polenta (which was PHENOMENAL). Our friend ordered the same meal and was blown away as well. He was the same friend with us on our previous encounter at Bern's with the awful server, Jamal. 

Kurt S, you have restored my faith in Bern's again! Thank you:)
