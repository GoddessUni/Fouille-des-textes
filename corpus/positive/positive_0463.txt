For those saying this is regular hospital food, you should check out the cafeteria at the Hospital of University of Pennsylvania, then revise the review. 

While not gourmet by any means, CHOP's cafeteria contains lots of options, especially if you are spending extended time at the hospital.  

They have a nice salad bar where you pick your base (mixed greens, romaine, or spinach) then add 5 fresh toppings - all for about $5.  
There's a Mediterranean bar that has hummus, pita, grilled asparagus, etc.  
There's a sandwich bar with fresh made sandwiches and house-cooked chips.  
There's a burrito/taco bar.  
There's pizza and a burger bar as well with all the fried sides you could imagine
They also have sushi, which is usually fresh fish and decent.
And..they have Chinese food, which always smells and looks much better than it actually tastes.  So tread carefully.

Sure, you can say there's nothing special and the prices can be quite expensive, but for a hospital, not bad at all!

If you unfortunately end up being at CHOP, give it at try, and hopefully the staff will great you and serve you with a huge smile to brighten your day.
