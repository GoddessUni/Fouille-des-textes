Suburban classy... I like this place, seated immediately on a Sunday at 5:00pm isn't bad at all. 

You have other choices on Baltimore pike but for a different experience we tried Charlie Brown and actually liked it.

Two picky kids enjoyed the free (with yelp check in) firecracker shrimp which is probably a spin off on bang bang shrimp at (bonefish grille) but let's just call it the younger version, shrimp are tinier... yet tasty and they do give you a lot. 

Food came out fast. our Waitress was new but she was fast, couldn't tell she was new.

very cute giant booth we were seated in, not too noisy...

I had a garlic crusted steak w mashed potatoes, great! that was after two Delicious Margaritas... yum!

everyone enjoyed their meal they are more expensive than famous Dave's or miller ale house but it is more classy.
