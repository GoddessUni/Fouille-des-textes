A pleasant early dinner at 717. Tried the lamb chops and it was pretty good. Nice and tender meat with a pistachio crust, includes sweet potatoes mash and green beans. It was enough for two people or maybe for a really hungry single person. I just wish they would serve it pre cut like lollipops. My date had the French martini and she said it was good. Wasn't stingy on the vodka:) Service was excellent; our waiter refreshed our basket of free focaccia with marina and herb butter sauce within 2 mins of finishing the bread without even having to ask. The hostess came over to ask us how are meal tasted. Very thoughtful. All in all the food is good (a 3 star), however the staff is excellent thus the four star review.
