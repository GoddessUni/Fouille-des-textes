I came here with a group of about 40 people from work, and the staff was very accommodating to us. We broke up into 4 groups of 10 in each Room, and we were in the Library.  I think most of the rooms have about a 30% Escape Rate and I must say, it was NOT easy!  Our group did great though, it was definitely a team experience and we got out about 3 minutes after the hour, that's how difficult the puzzles are! But we felt great about it and our staff guy helped us out JUST enough. If I came with just a few friends it might have been frustrating, but with 10 adults we did really well, and had a great time.
