This was my first visit to Primebar, but I wish I had checked it out sooner! I came here with my brother to meet up with some friends at around 8 PM, and the place was packed! We soon found out that the reason why was because of the Tuesday $5 burgers, which included the house specialty, the chef's creation for the evening. Since we had all eaten dinner already before getting there, we passed on the burgers, but I definitely want to come back and take advantage of that deal! Instead, we all ordered a side of Mac & Cheese with the addition of jalapeños and bacon. The mac & cheese was so creamy and delicious! The shells were soft and soaked in creamy cheddar cheese, and the bacon and jalapeños gave the dish more substance, body, and spice. The additions are definitely a must! I also enjoyed how the mac & cheese was topped with some panko crumbs, which game a little more texture to the dish. The side size was perfect for someone who isn't too hungry, but still has a little room to eat. My brother and friends also ordered a bottle of red wine which they were pretty happy with. It came chilled in a bucket of ice, and the waiter let them try it so that they could decide whether they liked it and wanted to commit to that bottle. It's nice to be given the choice!

We stayed at there until close, and throughout that time our waiter constantly was checking on us and making sure were doing alright. Since the place was busy when we got there, and I'm assuming during peak meal hours, be prepared for the noise level. It was hard to hear each other sometimes because of the many people crowded together, but it's manageable. Overall, I really enjoyed my experience here and can't wait to come back (especially to use that 50% off one appetizer reward that came from checking in)!
