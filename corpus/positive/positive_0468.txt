This place is right next door to one of my medical customer's office, and today was the second time stopped in for lunch.  

The neighborhood isn't the best, so I was not expecting much on the first visit - but it was great- and the second visit was great, too! 

This must be the cleanest, most efficient, and friendliest "quick food" place within miles.  In addition, if you look at the floors and counter tops behind the register area, I think you will see that this place is cleaner than most people keep their own house.

My second visit today confirmed that this place is consistently spotless, and the food is really good.  You get a great portion for your money here.

I ordered a half pound of fried shrimp, and asked the manager (that took my order at the counter) if I could have rice and beans instead of french fries...."No Problem!"

I thought I might be charged a little extra for subbing the beans/rice....that didn't happen!  

The rice and black beans were excellent, piping hot, and covered half the plate. (see the photo) and the shrimp were fried perfectly with a light batter (I think they batter the shrimp on site)....both nearly burned my mouth they were so fresh and hot.

My only wish is that this Salem's was closer to home.
