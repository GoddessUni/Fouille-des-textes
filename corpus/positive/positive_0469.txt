So after seeing all those commercials in the Miami market, and with VAGUE memories of the one we had in Homestead wayyy back in the days, I had the opportunity to try one during a business trip to Florida's West Coast. 

If I only had eaten the Strawberry Sundae, this would undoubtedly be a 5 star review. Served to the brim in about a 20 oz cup, it was filled pretty close to the trim with a thick sweet vanilla syrup, a substantial balance of strawberry syrup and a cherry on top (literally). Heck, I'd be more than willing to overlook the extra ten cents they charge for the berry. Even the chicken burger is 4, 4.5 star territory. The portion is adequate for the price, and the seasoning has a mild kick to it. They listened to my opting out of mayo, and were generous with the BBQ sauce (very important for me.)

However, I have to take a star and half off for the fries. The portion was small for the price, and the taste too plain almost as if they had  just refried frozen supermarket fries.

4 Stars in total, since they get an extra 0.5 for the cute waitress on roller skates!
