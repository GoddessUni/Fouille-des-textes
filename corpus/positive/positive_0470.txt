A friend and I went to Barbuzzo for Restaurant Week (sorry it took me so long to post this!), and we were both very excited to try it out because we'd heard sooo many good things!

We had a very early 5pm reservation, and we happy to see that we weren't the only ones dining so early! The tables are super tiny and we literally had to squeeze in and out of our table. To be honest, I was less inclined to eat a big meal after wards. I was afraid I'd get stuck in my puny seat!

After getting settled in, our server approached us. He was very nice and professional. For our Restaurant week dinner, I had the sheep's milk ricotta, the gnocchi and the blood orange tiramisu. The chef even sent out an additional plate (which I've never experienced for RW before). The main entree was smaller than what I think they serve normally, but I was OK with it. We also got an AMAZING bottle of "slightly sparkling" white wine that was utterly fantastic. I wish they sold it in at the wine store, but alas, I will be forced to go to Barbuzzo to enjoy it again...

Thanks Barbuzzo, I will be back soon!
