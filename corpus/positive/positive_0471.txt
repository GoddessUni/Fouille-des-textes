We stopped by chance with our six year old. We were craving Korean and arent really familiar with Tucson restaurants so we kind of just picked a resturant crossed our fingers and committed. We are so glad we did. The service was quick and the smiles were genuine. There was a single lady handeling eight tables and making it look way to easy. We spilled our drink and she was super nice as she cleaned it up and accepted all of my many embarressed apologies and gave us the complementary kimchi pancake. Which was amazing. All of the food came out fresh and delicious. My six year old gave the miso a 100 out of four stars :) my husband ordered a skillet meal and it was insanely hot without burning his meal or compromising the flavor. The Bulgogi was fantastic and we will definitely be going back.
