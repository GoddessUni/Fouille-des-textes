This is my new favorite ice cream parlor. My husband had a yummy peanut butter parfait type sundae that had they most gorgeous presentation of anything I've ever seen. I ordered the Magnolia Flower waffle cone. I've never tasted ice cream like that before. It was positively yummy!  The flavor reminded me of honeysuckle when I was a child. I would recommend this ice cream parlor to anyone wanting ice cream. Definitely the best in town as evidenced by the large number of customers. Even though it was absolutely packed with a line literally out the door the employees were quick and efficient, keeping the flow of customers moving in a timely manner. 

Update- Once again a five star experience. This time hubby and I both had the Peanut Butter Fudge. It was absolutely gorgeous and so yummy! We've decided to definitely ice cream here a regular treat. Next time I think I'll skip dinner beforehand though. The portions here are huge. I suggested sharing with my husband. He laughed at me. Yes, it's THAT good!
