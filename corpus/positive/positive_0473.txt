Really amazing high quality sushi. Been here a few times for dinner. Most recently just last weekend (Oct 2020). Ooka is very good at following social distancing rules. The indoor was set up with people seated very far from each other. I noticed many tables were not used to allow for that. They also have a tent with heaters. I will say that weather should be considered. While we were there the temp dropped to 40 degrees and personally, even with the heating lamp right behind me, I was freezing my butt off. 
Anyway, as for the food - everything we tried, appetizers and a bunch of different rolls was spectacular, fresh tasty and inventive. Bonus points for delicious Uni. I love uni but am hesitant in ordering it. Sometimes it can taste really funky. The uni here was very fresh (I had the sushi roll with quail egg on top). They also offer California live uni at $28 a pop. Would have loved to try it but we were splitting a check with a couple and I felt guilty. Will updated once I do. 
Service - absolutely top notch. Our server was above and beyond polite, fast and caring. 
Would highly recommend and go back in a heartbeat!
