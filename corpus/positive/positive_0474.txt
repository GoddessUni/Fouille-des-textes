The Modern is a hip renovation of a Travelodge Motel, and the small area near check-in houses an energetic bar packed with a wide range of people from local to foreign.  Both nights I stayed at the hotel were weeknights, and the bar was already booming early in the evening (I didn't see it later, but I imagine it only gets better).  For dinner I had the gnocchi (uh...when in Idaho....DUH, potatoes!!!) which was a great twist on a dish that somethings sits dully somewhere in the back of my mind with pasta. This one, while it did have some fresh heirloom cherry tomatoes, also had beautiful beet greens, unique cheeses below and atop, and green beans. Really a nice dish.  I followed it with a tiny three-dollar pot de creme, which was just enough to assuage the sweet tooth.  Our service wasn't great, the place was busy, but not THAT busy, and our waitress wasn't present as often as she could have been.  But the food was such an unexpected surprise for a small, boutique-style hotel.  I would definitely stay, and eat, here again.
