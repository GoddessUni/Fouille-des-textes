I'm so glad I discovered this place. From its vintage/hipster decor to its nontraditional food and drink menu, this place has got it goin' on. Their veggie burger is honestly the best I've ever had. And being an ex vegetarian, I've had my fair share of veggie burgers. 

I get the Doghouse every time I go. It's a salmon salad with roasted asparagus and mushrooms with a hefty supply of goat cheese served with a honey balsamic dressing. It's delish! Every bite is better than the last.

My only complaint would be the service. Two out of the three times I went the service was horrible. The food took forever to get out, the server forgot to put items in.. it was a mess. Thankfully, the food is so good that I can look past that. 

I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a chill night with good friends, food and music.
