Can't believe it has taken me so long to review this place! It is definitely one of the best spots in STL. Staff is awesome, prices fair, good atmosphere and food is top notch. 

I come here often for their lunch menu, it's definitely an office favorite - specifically the ensalada, oven baked goat cheese, And chicken salad sandwich. The chips that come with the sandwiches are really good, but i have subbed in Brussels sprouts for an upcharge before and it is so worth it. I have tried almost all of the other sandwiches and you can't go wrong with any of them. 

I've only been a couple times for dinner, but my faves are the street tacos, chicken wings, and most of all the bacon jam flat bread!!!! I'm not a huge fan of bacon jam normally but this is soooo yummy. I haven't tried much of the meat/seafood entrees yet but I look forward to on my next visit. 

Overall, nothing bad to say about this place - Everyone I've brought here has loved it as much as I do!
