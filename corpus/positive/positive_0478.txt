I feel like I was the last Yelper to try 4 Rivers, but I (finally) got to try it out this weekend.  First off, I love the lay out and set up of the joint.  Easy ordering at the counter and you get the food very quickly!

As for the food:  I loved the sides!  The fried okra was just delicous.  The mac and cheese was so cheesy.  The cornbread was amazing texture  The collards - mm hmmm!  My husband got a really good sandwich with pork and coleslaw.  I didn't love my burnt ends sandwich, but I would definitely come back and order something else.

All in all, twas a good experience.  I look forward to coming back and trying some more of the delicious sides (and I will save room for dessert next time)!
