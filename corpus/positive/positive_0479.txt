I love Sugar Sweet Bakery! The bakery is a little hidden, but in a convenient location with lots of parking. I like to stop there after lunch at Falora. Their cookies are amazing! The Lemon Sugar Cookie, Toffee Turtle, Snickerdoodle, Chunky Monkey, White Chocolate Macadamia, all of them are heavenly. My favorite is the Whole Shebang. Loaded with nuts, chocolate chips, oats, coconut and I don't know what else! This cookie is dangerous! I think about it whenever I have a craving for something sweet. It goes perfectly with an ice cold glass of milk or a hot coffee. Sugar Sweet is my new go to when I don't want to make dessert or I need something delicious for a potluck or as a gift to someone special. They also have several options that are gluten free.

I am still in my honeymoon phase with these cookies so I haven't tried the cakes, but they are on my "To do" list! The "smallest" cake has got to be at least 10 inches high! They have a beautiful Red Velvet cake, a sky-high Banana cake and several jam cakes. I can't wait to try all of them!
