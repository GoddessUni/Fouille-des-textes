I was waking in the record breaking heat along the busy Street side and decided that I didn't want to be caught up in the crowds who were dining outside due to COVID. I happened to ask at a breakfast spot if there were others in the area. I was recommended to come to De Angelo's. So happy it was nearby enough to make it in. Loved the food, service was great and I left with a fresh baked loaf of sourdough they sliced for me. They even accommodated my special request to add sauteed spinach and mushrooms to my order. Thankfully they had restrooms we could use as well which is somewhat difficult to come by these days. Highly recommend!
