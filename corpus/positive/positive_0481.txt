Evos is always a great choice when I need something fast and don't want to regret the burger and fries right after I eat it!

I took my wife here the other day and it was her first time in. She was excited because she's all into the healthy kick right now. The place is modern looking and she thought the place was new. She was so surprised that this location has been open close to around10 years. Hats off to the local owners that keep this place looking and feeling fresh and new!

The cashiers were friendly and it only took about 4 minutes for our order to be complete. 

For those of you reading and thinking they need to go to Wendy's, MD's or the BK to get a fast burger, you should really give this place a shot. Start out with their original burger and air fries. You can't go wrong here. If you're really feeling adventurous try one of their shakes!

I had all the above and still walked out of there not regretting I just stuffed my face!
