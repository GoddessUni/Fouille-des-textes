I really loved Brewery ARS on my first visit a month or so ago. My brother and SIL were in town so we did a family/friends night out and there was a group of about ten of us bouncing around. ARS was our second stop and I think we spent more time there than anywhere else. 

The beers were fresh and crisp. I don't drink craft beer very often anymore, but when I do I like west coast style pale ales and IPAs. So if you dig that style, you'll probably really enjoy much of the selection here.  

The tasting room is definitely small but we lucked out during our Saturday night visit. We had mostly standing room to begin but by the time we closed the place down there were plenty of open tables. I'd recommend going during an off time if you want to grab a seat and relax. Otherwise, grab a brew and make some friends!
