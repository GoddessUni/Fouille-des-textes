So we decided on this pizza place because my sister in law said it was good. The reason for the docked star is because how long it took to deliver. An hour and a half at around 5:30 pm for dinner and didn't arrive until close to 7. Very disappointed in that but the pizza was very good! We all ordered our own little 10" pizza and it had that thick crust you usually want. They don't have a ton of options for toppings (basil, roasted garlic etc) as another franchise like say Blaze pizza but all in all it was good. I will say though if you are hangry, go somewhere else or maybe see if you can pickup!
