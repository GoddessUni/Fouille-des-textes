If I could give this more than 5 stars, I would. Had lunch here. Atmosphere was awesome with a lofty feel and very interesting art pieces throughout. Service was excellent (thanks Nick). The on site brewed craft beers were very good. There was something for everyone without having too many selections to confuse you. The food was absolutely fabulous. The four of us shared several dishes including the fried okra, crab mac-n-cheese, alligator hush puppies, lobster roll, grouper sandwich and a burger. All were outstanding with a lot of flavors. We are all planning our next trip back to this gem as soon as we can.
