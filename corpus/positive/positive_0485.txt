I'm not a ramen expert.  But the Obon Ramen is really delicious.  The reason I keep coming back is the sushi.  They make really unique, fresh sushi here, using uncommon ingredients like fresh basil to keep it interesting.  I really want to try the Steam Buns next time.  Service is good--especially if you sit at the bar.  Nice draft selection featuring local beers and Japanese beer.  The cocktail menu is appealing, featuring interesting ingredients.  You can tell the people who are making the drink and food menus really care about their craft.  This place is so much better than Gio Taco, which occupied the space before.  If I'm having a "treat yoself" kind of day, this is one of my first choices.
