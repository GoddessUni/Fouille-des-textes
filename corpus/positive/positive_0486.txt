My boyfriend is sort of a sno cone connoiseur, so when I found out Oh Lolli Lolli sold sno cones, I surprised him with a visit.  

This is a very cute little candy shoppe with a seemingly great selection of candies.  They had some things that I hadn't seen it years.  This trip was all about the sno cones though. 

Based on a recommendation from the very young and perky employee, I went with wedding cake/champagne mix for my flavor.  It sounded just as strange to me, but the employee said it was one of her favorites and that she was sure I would like it too. Turns out she was wrong. I wasn't a huge fan, but the ice was really snow-like.  My boyfriend chose a more standard flavor, peach, and it was delicious.  It was the best sno cone I have had in St. Louis yet. 

I will be back for a sno cone, but I will definitely stick with a flavor I know that I will like and probably pick up some candy too!  :)
