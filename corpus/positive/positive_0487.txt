4.5 stars, and I'm always so liberal with stars! 
This place was great, the service, atmosphere and food so I suggest everyone go at least once.
To be quite honest, I thought they would be a bit more pricey but between the two of us we only spent $75 on 2 appetizers, an entree, a half dozen oysters, 1 side, beer and dessert. 
I enjoyed everything except the dessert which wasn't terrible but entirely too too sweet! I'm a sweets person but you may want to forgo the candied duck bacon maple fried ice cream to experience something else. Also, my charbroiled oysters were to die for, but my first bite had a bit of shell (comes with the territory) which was pretty off putting but no issues after that.
