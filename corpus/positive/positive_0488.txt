I'm new to the area and was looking for a new Caribbean soul food place nearby. Although I live in the same town, the place is way out in the middle of nowhere. However, upon arriving, I immediately knew that they served authentic Jamaican cuisine. It reminded me a lot of when I visited Jamaica! They were very nice and apologetic regarding their being out of curry chicken. I opted for jerk chicken. I got the rice and peas, mac n cheese, and candied yams as my sides. The chicken and yams were by far the best parts of the meal! I agree with another reviewer that the portions are great. It was so good that I ate the entire platter in one sitting. I felt like I was going to burst, but it was worth it. I'm so glad I finally found a place like this that is comparable to Jamaica. If you want authentic Jamaican food, this is it!
