This was a great find while in Nashville with my daughter. We found it on a whim at the Downtown location when pressed for time on a busy Friday night. We sat at the bar because of a long wait for a table and ordered the New Fashioned Mason Jar Cocktail, House Hot Chicken Tenders and the Mac & Cheese topped with Hot Chicken. It was so wonderful we returned on Sunday and ordered it again as the last taste of Nashville before we flew out of town. Rob our waiter at the bar was fabulous and even remembered us upon our returned visit on Sunday. Highly recommend this place for tasty, uniquely prepared Nashville eats! The BEST mac & cheese in town!
