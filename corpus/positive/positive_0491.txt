My best meal in New Orleans was unplanned.  Dante's Kitchen is a bit out of the way from the main bustling downtown, but after spending the day at the zoo, I'd taken a short bus-trip north to go to a different restaurant.  Luckily, my intended dining destination was closed on Sundays, and I popped into Dante's instead.

The biscuits and gravy were out of this world.  It was the best dish I had in New Orleans--full stop.  The texture of the biscuits was so perfectly velvety, it's hard to describe how delicious it is.  The other food we had was all good as well, but those BISCUITS AND GRAVY!
