A great place for a business lunch. The place is really nice, in a 1950's manly kinda way. The food is pretty good. The best thing is definitely the lemon cake, seriously, I could eat a whole pie of it. The chocolate mousse was really bitter though. The bread pudding and creme brulee were just standard. Overall this is a nice and safe choice for business lunching. The only thing that seems a bit out of place is the waitresses uniforms...tight black shirts, shorts and stockings...it does throw the vibe off a bit...but I'm sure the core audience does not mind! Also, our waitress was super friendly and nice, actually one of the best waitresses I've had in the city (sorry, can't recall the name =() She was friendly and easy going but not in a fake or awkward way. A+ for that!
