Cosy, comfy and completely adorable! The Tea Girl is a lovely little spot to pull up a chair with a good book or good friend and great pot of tea. 

The old mishmash of old furniture with well worn cushions and one off tea cups and saucers  reminds me of my family sitting around the cottage as a kid, taking tea - everyone in a completely different seat from the next. I love it! Warm and comforting, as tea should be. 

There is a large selection of loose leaf teas to choose from, with many different flavours in a plethora of tea categories. I like to browse through the $1 sample bags at the front counter. It's a great way to try out new teas at home... I also like to keep a sample or two in my purse, you know, for tea emergencies - like when you show up at someones house and they only have a dusty old box of Red Rose! 

Pinkies up!
