I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time. The usual volley of "where do you want to eat" was occurring and the Drunken Chicken was near by. 

It has a nice open front and felt very inviting. There's a nice selection of beers on tap. And an equally nice selection of can beers. 

The board had a couple of specials and interesting appetizers. They were fried green beans, balls, fried deviled eggs, onion rings. 
The specials were a bird dog and a stack (I may be wrong). 

We order the balls, fried deviled eggs, bird dog and the stack. 

There were some great things about each item. The  bird dog was pretty good sans bun. The bird dog is a chicken strip wrapped in bacon with cheese on top. 
The stack was quite tasty and very filling. It was two fried potato patties mixed with bacon, Monterrey jack cheese and jalape√±os. 
With red eye gravy in top, bacon and a fried egg. It was quite good. I was just sad my egg was not a bit more over easy and not so firm. The runny egg would have been a great treat. 

The balls were similar to the potato patties, just with bacon inside. With a side of redeye bacon gravy. 

The fried deviled eggs are self explanatory. The deviled part was good. The egg whites are a bit rubbery. 

It was good and will try other items next time.
