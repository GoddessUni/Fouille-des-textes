This is in a good location that's easy to get to and the staff is very friendly! I got a really good Havana coffee that was prepared well and packed with flavor. It was on the hot drink list but they were so nice about making it iced for me without losing any flavor. I also got the spinach croissant and they warmed it up for me. It was a great thing to munch on while enjoying my coffee. They have huge bright windows, a drive through if you're in a hurry, and when it's warmer they have outdoor seating which I would love to come back and enjoy. I took away one star because the place is great, but all the seating is not super comfortable or cozy so I don't know that I would go and hangout there for a long time, but they do have different options of seating which is nice.
