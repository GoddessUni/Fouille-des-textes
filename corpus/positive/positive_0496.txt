Went there on the recommendation of an Ethiopian server at a local sushi restaurant!  We were glad not to have to find an Ethiopian restaurant in a strange city on our own. FABULOUS!  Because we couldn't make up our minds, we ordered "The Works" for the three of us. It was enormous!  It had a sampling of every dish on the menu and we'd have a hard time choosing a favorite...all we're excellent. There was no way we could finish it all so we took a lot home and easily got two more meals out of it. Good service. Attentive with the water pitcher which I always appreciate.  Will definitely return only next visit to Tucson.  Loved it.
