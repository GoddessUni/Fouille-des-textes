The Sushi Station is a wonderful and fresh addition the already delicious Webster Groves restaurant scene!  The restaurant is furnished with a simple, yet elegant theme.  Big front windows allow for fantastic lighting while the warm wooden walls make you feel right at home.  

The menu is very straight forward with a wide appeal.  Traditional Japanese entrees such as Katsu-Kare and Tempura Udon compliment a well constructed and fun sushi menu.  Sushi offerings range from traditional nigiri (single piece of fish atop rice) and basic tuna and salmon rolls to larger rolls composed of fresh fish, various veggies, and tasty sauces!

I cannot compliment this new restaurant enough!  The staff is very friendly, quite knowledgeable of their offerings, and eager to help out patrons make the always tough decision of which rolls to try!
