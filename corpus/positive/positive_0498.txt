A great Diner dinning experience. It's a no frills, no non-sense no time for food pics kind of place. You get in, sit on a couch and wait for someone to seat you. You climb on a 50's style bar stool and sit up against a single counter top that curves around this small but nostalgic diner. Love the Mickey clock on the wall!  Menus are laid out in front of you with corresponding order sheets for the waiter to check off your order (don't touch it!). The menu is basic but exactly what you need for a breakfast place. We ordered pancakes with three bacon,  a waffle with three bacon, a bacon omelette and mushroom omelette. The waiter calls off the order to the quick order chefs five feet away reminiscent of the famous Philly cheese-steak joints.  Within 5 minutes our first order came out and in 10 minutes all four dishes was out and served. That quick! The omelettes were crazy good. Don't let the look deceive you. The pancakes and waffles were of average size and fluffy-enough. Perfect size for kids or a side order for hungry adults. In 20 minutes we were done and out! They ask if you are leaving a cash tip to leave it on the counter with your server.  Had to run 9 miles to work it off but will definitely be back!
