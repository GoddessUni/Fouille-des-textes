Came in last night with work colleagues who had visited the night before. The food is phenomenal, and the menu had a wide variety so everyone was happy. Started out with the cheese and ale dip...very tasty. Our server Erica was very knowledgeable and offered suggestions for those of us who wanted to pair our food with beers. I had the Red Eye amber beer with the meatloaf. YUM! One of the best meatloafs I've ever had. Loved the white cheddar mashed potatoes that accompanies it. It was busy but Erica made sure to check in on us and that our drinks were full at all times. Everyone enjoyed the experience. We will be back!
